20171024-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171024-11:07:45_5 TO SAY IAM VERY WORRIED WITH THIS IDEA OF AN EXTRAORDINARY COUNCIL ON THE COMPOSITION OF A EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT THIS IS A COMPETENCE IN THE POWER OF OUR PARLIAMENT THAT THEN IS TO BE APPROVED BY THE COUNCIL IT'S TRUE BUT WE HAVE MADE A HUGE PROGRESS AND I AS A PROFESSOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_1 IN THIS CASE BECAUSE OF TIMING FACTORS THE REPORTS FOR TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER BUT TAKING UP ONE OF THE POINTS MENTIONED BY COMMISSIONER BARROW A LITTLE BIT EARLIER IT IS THE CASE THAT THE CONTEXT OF OUR CONSIDERATION OF THESE REPORTS HAS CHANGED RATHER MARKEDLY SINCE IN FACT WE BEGAN THE EXERCISE OF CONSIDERING THE REPORT SOME TIME AGO

20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_5 IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WE UNDERSTAND THAT WORKING ON THE COHERENCE OF OUR POLICIES MUST GO HAND IN HAND WITH SUPPORTING COUNTRIES IN THEIR EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN NATIONAL AND LOCAL INSTITUTIONS AND MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENTS AND UOSE OF FORES RESOURCES I WISH I WAS TO THANK AGAIN

20090204-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20090204-17:04:59_5 BUT THIS CAN ONLY BE DECIDED AT A NATIONAL LEVEL BECAUSE THE SUPPORT APART FROM THE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK MENTIONED BY MISTER BOHOYGAN THAT SUPPORT CAN ONLY BE PROVIDED BY NATIONAL TAX PAYERS BUT THERE IS ONE THING THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION CAN CONSTRUCTIVELY DO HERE AT LEAST UNTIL THE RECESSIONS OVER AND THAT'S GIVE
20090324-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20090324-22:20:58_8 AMONG OTHER PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE AMENDMENTS TABLED BY MY POLITICAL GROUP I WISH PARTICULARLY SUPPORT THE SHARING OF INFORMATION FROM ANIMAL TESTING SO TO AVOID THE NEED FOR NEW TESTS INVOLVING ANIMALS
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-10:39:42_2 IT IS THEREFORE ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE COUNTRIES AS TURKEY FOR EXAMPLE CONTRIBUTES WITH MERCENARIES AMONG OTHER THINGS TO WORSEN THE SITUATION A EVEN MORE IN YOU IS A REGIEN BUILT ON THE IDEA THAT DIALOGUE IS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD FOR LONG LASTING PEACE IT IS OUR DUTY AT THE SAME TIME TO TAKE LEADERSHIP OF THOSE IDEAS IN OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES

20130911-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20130911-19:51:52_5 WE SUGGEST THAT IT WOULD BE DONE IN A VERY TOROFUL WAY IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THEIR EF EFFECTIVENESS AND ADAPT THEIR SCOPE NATURE AND VALIDITY REACTING TO THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COUNTRY
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-20:08:31_5 A STRONG RISK BASED APPROACH OFFERS THE BEST WAY FORWARD HERE THESE CHALLENGES ARE DIFFICULT BUT I FULLY SUPPORT THEY EFFECT THE EFFORTS OF ALL THE RAPPORTURES HERE TO DAY AND WE ARE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO SATISFY LEGAL SITUATION BUT THESE REPORTS ARE AN EXCELLENT START
20150527-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150527-20:59:58_6 TO DAY THE PRESIDENCY AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT RECEIVED KEY IMPUT FROM THE COMMISSION ON ITS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE MOST CHALLENGING ISSUES IN THE DIRECTIVE REGARDING SCOPE AND SEVERAL ASPECTS OF IMPLEMENTATION THAT WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL IN MAKING THE LAST REMAINING STRIDES
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_10 IT IS HIGH TIME THE COUNCIL CAME UP WITH MORE COORDINATE ETURGE ANT SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS AND DECISIONS TO THE CRISIS CREATED AFTER ALL BY THE IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR OF SOME BANKS THIS PARLIAMENT AND THE COMMISSION ESPECIALY COMMISSIONE BARNIER HAVE BEEN MAKING SPECIFIC PROPOSALS AND  INITIATIVES YET WE SEEM TO MOVE VERY SLOWLY
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_24 CONCERNING SUBHEADING ONE B ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND TERRITORIAL COHESION WHICH IS ANOTHER COR POLICY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR THE CREATION AND GROW OF GROWTS AND JOBS THE COUNCIL PROPOSES LIMITED REDUCTIONS OF PAYMENT APPROPRIATIONS ON NEW PROGRAMMS OF ONE HUNDREDN NINETY NINE MILLION EURO
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_2 ITS VIRTUAL CURRENCIES AND DISTRIBUTED LEGER TECHNOLOGY SO ONE WOULD BE FORGIVEN BY THINKING WHELE THIS IS A DULL AND SOMNIFEROUS SUBJECT THAT PERHAPS WILL GENTLY PUT US INTO SLEEP  AT THIS HOUR LATE HOUR OF THE DAY
20090310-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090310-09:24:48_10 HOWEVER IN THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CARNERSBEING GIVEN THAT CARS ARE NOT BEING SOLD IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD WITH COUNSEL THAT IN FACT THIS TWELVE MONTHS WAS PROBABLY UNREALISTIC AND WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THE SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES OF GETTING RID OF TIRES
20090203-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090203-19:30:15_3 AND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE M EUROPEAN SOCIAL FUND COULD BE USED IN A TARGETED WAY TO TRY AND HELP YOUNG PEOPLE CONSIDERING  THE PROBLEMSE THAT THIS CAUSES NOT ONLY TO THEMSELVES AS INDIVIDUALS BUT TO THEIR FAMILIES AND TO THEIR COMMUNITIES WHICH IT CAN HAVE A VERY SEVERE EFFECT ON COMMUNITIES
20090422-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20090422-21:33:05_3 I'M BAFFLED AT THE NOTION OF EXTENDING THE TERM OF COPYRIGHT WHETHER IT'S TO SEVENTY YEARS OR NINETY FIVE YEARS AND I'M BAFFLED BY IT NOT JUST BECAUSE  IT'S DUBIOUS AND ALMOST OUT OF STEP WITH THE DIGITAL AGE BUT ALSO BECAUSE QUITE CLEARLY A MOVE LIKE THAT WILL PRIMARILY
20090310-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20090310-19:11:19_3 M I'M A RECENT A PARTICIPANT IN THE A TWITTER SIGHT AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT IAM MORE THAN SURPRISED AND IMPRESSED ABOUT HOW MUCH AR INFORMATION IS ON THAT SITE R FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION M IT GIVES A HUGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND I'D LIKE TO CONGRATULATE THEM FOR THAT
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_4 FACED WITH HA DRAMATIC DECLINE AND PRIVATE FLOWS OF CREDIT WE CAME TOGETHER LAST MONTH WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP TO LAUNCH THE JOIND I OF I ACTION PLAN IN SUPPORT OF BANKING SYSTEMS AND LANDING TO THE REAL ECONOMY IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE
20090504-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090504-17:16:47_3 IT IS NOT DEMOCRATICALLY OPPROBRIATE THAT THIS HOUSE WOULD SET ASIDE THE VERDICT OF IRELAND OR THAT THIS HOUSE WOULD BE USED TO RACHET UP PRESSURE ON IRELAND IN THE COMING MONTHS TO ADOPT A TREATY THAT IS CLEARLY NOT IN OUR INTERESTS OR IN THE INTERESTS OF THE EUROPEAN PEOPLE
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_13 I THINK THE SECOND THING THAT WE'VE GOT TO REALISE DESPITE ALL THE DIFFERENT POLITICAL VIEWS IN THIS IN THIS PARLIAMENT IS THAT GLOBAL CO OPERATION NOT JUST IN BANKING INSTITUTIONS BUT GLOBAL CO OPERATION IN OTHER AREAS IN FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY AND ANFOR TRADE HAVE GOT TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF HOW WE APPROACH THE FUTURE
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_11 WITH THIS WIDE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN AND ARE DEVELOPING THE COORDINATION AND COROPORATION MECHANISMS TO DO SO AND WE SEE AS WE SAW LAST AUGUST WHEN FACED WITH THE CONFLICT DRIVEN BANKING CRISIS IN GEORGIA
20151202-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20151202-22:34:44_13 WE CALL ON THE COMMISSION AND THE MEMBER STATES TO FURTHER ADDRESS THE ROODE CAUSES OF ARMED CONFLICTS AND CORRUPTION AND TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND PEACE BUILDING STRATEGIES IN THE PARK AND IN THE SURROUNDING REGION AND WE ALSO URGE THE COMMISSION THE MEMBER STATES THE D R C
20170314-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20170314-19:47:58_4 THAT'S EVIDENT FROM THE RECENTLY LEAKED CABLES WITH ONE PARTICIPANT STATING IT'S IMPRESSIVE TO SEE HOW SOME MEMBER STATES PRESENT THEMSELVES OUTWARDLY AS PROPONENTS OF TAX REFORMS AND AT THE SAME TIME TO WATCH IN THE CODE OF CONDUCT GOP HOW THEY ACTUALLY BEHAVE IN EU DISCUSSIONS PROTECTED BY CONFIDENTIALITY
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-10:48:45_1 WELCOMING CRIMINALS INTO OUR EUROPEAN UNION WITH OPEN ARMS JUST BECAUSE THOSE CRIMINALS ARE  AR RICH IS TOTALLY OUTRAGEOUS AND MEANS FORFEITING THAT TRUST BECAUSE REGARDLESS OF WHAT A SEPRIATE MALTISE BULGARIAN OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT THINKS THE ACCESS
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_8 AS PART OF THE SEPTEMBER TWELFTH OUTCOME THE COMMISSION ALSO AGREED TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL TO EXTEND UNTIL THE END OF TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THE AUTONOMOUS TRADE PREFERENCES CURRENTLY GRANTED TO A CRANE AS THEY WILL OTHERWISE CEASE TO APPLY AS OF
20131209-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131209-19:07:30_7 STILL ONE MONTH AFTER WE VOTED OUR COMPROMISE THE COUNCIL DID NOT PUT IT ON THE AGENDA DID NOT EVEN PRESENT IT I USED THIS TIME TO TALK WITH THE MEMBERSTATES AND THE PRESIDENCY

20090423-0900-PLENARY-25-en_20090423-21:41:42_1 ALL I WOULD SAY IS THAT I THINK IT IS A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF THE OVERALL G D P SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE THIRTEEN PER CENT AND MATERIALS SAY FOUR OR FIVE PER CENT SO IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT SECTOR I AM A CIVIL ENGINEER BY BACKGROUND AND IT WAS A PRIVILEGE TO DO THE OPINION ON BEHALF OF THE IND 
20150430-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150430-09:30:09_3 THE BANK DID IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE BECOME A PIONEER WHEN IT ADOPTED A POLICY AGAINST NON CO OPERATIVE JURISDICTIONS BUT AS WE ALL KNOW THAT POLICY HAS LOST MANY OF ITS TEETH AS THOSE JURISDICTIONS HAVE CREATIVELY COMPLIED WITH THE LETTER OF O E C D REQUIREMENTS RATHER THAN COMPLYING WITH THEIR SPIRIT
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_3 IT IS ABOUT STRIKING THE BALANCE BETWEEN REGULATORY AND MARKET BASE INSTRUMENTS WITH THE AIM OF DEVELOPING VOLUNTARY STANDARDS FOR VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR HELPING TO OPTIMIZE PRODUCTION PROCESSES AND MAKE MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES
20141021-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20141021-18:44:22_5 SO THAT NOW THE REPLY FROM THE COUNCIL IS WHETHER THE COUNCIL AND THE MEMBERSSAYS PREFER TO TAKE THIS MONEY TO THEIR OWN POCKETS AND IGNORE THE COMMITMENTS THEY'VE MADE IN THE PAST AND IGNORE THE PAYMENTS THEY HAVE TO MAKE OR THEY WANT TO REALLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM SHOW THE R EUROPEAN WEEL AND PAY THE BILLS
20180531-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180531-15:00:20_7 IN ORDER TO COMBAT AND PREVENT SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND WITHIN INTERNATIONAL AID ORGANIZATIONS IS THA ROOM FOR GUIDE LINES WITHIN THE EUS EXTERNAL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD MAKE FUNDING STRICTLY CONDITIONAL UPON RESPECT FOR PRINCIPLES OVERSIGHT GUIDE LINES ACCOUNTABILITY AND REGULAR REPORTING FROM BENEFICERS ON THIS ISSUE
20091124-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20091124-09:52:50_3 IN ORDER TO HAVE SUCH A GLOBAL AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO PERSUADE OTHER COUNTRIES  TOTO TO COME FORWARD WE HAVE TO KEEP A PRESSING BY OUR EXAMPLE AN EXAMPLE WHICH HAS ITS MORAL IMPORTANCE
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_13 IT IS NOT MEANT TO DO THIS AND THIS IS WHY I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO THOSE WHO ARE NOT LISTENING THE FACTS BUT FOLLOWING THE ALTERNATIVE NEWS AND NOT TRYING TO GO INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE  ANALYSIS OF THE TRAYE DEAL PLEASE DO NOT BARK AT THE WRONG TREE
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-21:57:09_12 THE PRACTICAL REFLECTION AND THE RELATION WITH EUROPEAN SEMESTIRY ESTABLISHED COHESION CONCERNS WITH THREE FOURTHS OF THE COUNTRY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE MADE THE PERFORMER'S FRAMEWORK AS AN EXAMPLE AS I SAID FOR THIS
20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:23:04_5 AND FINALLY SANCTIONS A PART OF THE EFFICIENTY OF POLICIES I PROPOSE THAT WE SHOULD MAKE THESE MORE EFFICIENT TARKETING CONCRETE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR BREAKING INTERNATIONAL LAWS AND HUMAN RIGCVIRATIONS
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_7 YES WE ARE LIVING IN TIMES OF EXTRAORDINARY UNPREDICTABILITY AND IT WOULD BE A BIG MISTAKE TO UNDERESTIMATE THE MAJOR'S SET BICG SETBACKS AND CHALLENGES BUT IT WOULD BE AN EVEN BIGGER MISTAKE TO FALL INTO A MAGGED NEGATIVE MINDSET AND RESIGN OURSELVES TO DOING NOTHING
20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_14 WHEN THE RISK ASSESSMENT HAS SHOWN THAT THE COUNTRY OF ORIGY FORIDZIN PRESENTS HIGH RISK OF ADMINISTRATIVE CORRUPTION OR IN COUNTRIES WHERE ENFORCEMENT OF NATIONAL LAWS IS WEAK ADDITIONAL GUARANTEES ARE NECESSARY TO UNDERPIN THE CERTIFIED LEGALITY
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_22 A SECOND ISSUE WHICH IS IMPORTANT AND AND ALSO AN ACHIEVEMENT FOR THE PARLIAMENT IS WEARE REFLECTING THAT WEARE LIVING IN AN EVER CHANGING INNOVATION ENVIRONMENT A IT'S NEW ITS FAST ITS AMBITIONS ITS DRIVEN BY VISI CAPITAL AND ITS COMPETITIVE
20090310-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090310-09:24:48_21 AS MISTER HARBOR AND THE COMMISSIONERS POINTED OUT SIMPLIFICATION IS A PART OF THIS PROPOSAL AND I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND FINALLY I WOULD DRAW ATTENTION TO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN TERMS OF  IN DEMANDING GREATER EMPHASIS IN ROAD SERVICES IN REDUCING NOISE
20180205-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180205-20:59:23_4 WE PROVE TO DAY THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION CAN DELIVER CONCRETE RESULTS FOR THE CITIZENS ALL OVER EUROPE BRINGING POSITIVE CHANGES IN OUR DAILY LIVES BUT FOR THE FULL COMPLETION OF THE DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET WE STILL NEED MANY REFORMS AND A LOT OF WORK
20090324-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20090324-22:20:58_2 WE KNOW FROM OUR PAST EXPERIENCE WITH THE SIMILAR ISSUES THAT TACKLE BOTH FOOD SAFETY AND EDICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN HUMANS ASH DOMINANT SPECIES AND HE NATURE THAT PUBLIC PERCEPTION DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON THE SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE MATTER
20160704-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20160704-17:45:12_6 RATHER THAN ALLOWING MANUFACTURERS TO UNDERCUT EACH OTHER'S IN A RACE TO THE BOTTOM ON ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS THESE AMBITIOUS AND BINDING MEASURES OF AN R M M WILL INSURE INDUSTRY IS MANUFACTURING PROGRESSIVELY CLEANER ENGINES FOR THESE MACHINES WHICH WILL GO A LONG WAY TO CLEANING UP TOXIC AIR POLLUTION IN THE AL

20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_18 SO WHAT WE ADVOCATE IN THE REPORT IS NOT TO STIFLE INVASION BY REGULATING NOW BUT INSTEAD AN E TO CLOSELY MONITOR WHAT'S GOING ON BY THE CREATION OF A TASK FORCE WI WHICH IFH A SUGGESTION BE CREATED AT THE LEVEL OF THE COMMISSION  AND AND THEN TO REGULATE
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:32:20_9 IN THIS SITUATION TRYING TO POLITICIZE THIS DEBATE WITH DIFFERENT ISSUES IS A HUGE MISTAKE FIRST BECAUSE THESE THREE COUNTRIES ARE NOT IN THE SAME SITUATION AND SECOND BECAUSE THE ACCESSION TO SHENGEN CANNOT BE MIXED WITH THE CO OPERATION AND BERIFICATION MECHANISM
20170216-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170216-10:16:10_3 THIS IS VERY MUCH DEPLORABLE BUT MY PROBLAM IS THAT THIS DEBATE IS SOMEWHAT OUT OF THE CONTEXT OF URGENCIES BECAUSE AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW THAT DURING THIS YEAR IN IRAN TEN TIMES MORE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXECUTED
20110706-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20110706-18:21:36_2 THROUGH VARIOUS PROGRAMMES AND EXCHANGE OF BEST PRACTICES AND TO KNOW HOW AND BY ASSURING THE AVAILABILITY OF NECESSARY FUNDING FOR EDUCATION TRAINING AGUARENESS RAISING AND EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN AS WELL AS FOR THE CONTINUOUS FIGHT AGAINST GENDER VIOLENCE STEREAOTYPES AND DISCRIMINATION
20171211-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20171211-21:06:24_1 MUCH TO BE WORRIED ABOUT PERSECUTION OF OPPOSITION AND JOURNALISTS AND THEREFORE I THINK THE E HAS TO STAND UP FIRST OF THE RFOR THE EUROPEAN VALUES AND CONDITION ENHANCED COPERATION ON CONVINCING PROGRESS IN THE FIELD OF HUMAN RIGHTS
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:40:08_6 AND LET ME PUT A FINAL QUESTION DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT ONE PER CENT OF BERCHARDS ONE PER CENT OF G D P IS THE FAST TRACK THE BIG WAY FOR THE BIG GOVERNMENT OF EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS
20170613-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170613-18:48:07_1 THE SITUATION IN THE D ARCE IS INDEED ER TERRIBLE AND IT HAS BEEN ER THIS WAY FOR FOR QUITE A WHILE AND ER I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ER ABOUT THE HANDLING OF THE CURRENT ISSUE WITH REGARD TO THE KAZAI PROVINCE
20180702-0900-PLENARY-en_20180702-19:18:18_3 TO ME AS AN ENVIED M E P THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHAINS OR TO THE RIGHTS OF AN INGENIOUS PEOPLE ARE VEARY VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART BECAUSE WARMIN CLIMATE IS THE DIRECT OR INDIRECT CAURSE FOR MANY OF THE VIOLATIONS AGAINST THEIR RIGHTS
20180702-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20180702-19:18:18_3 TO ME AS AN ENVIED MY P THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGS OR TO THE RIGHTS OF IN INGENIOUS PEOPLE ARE REARY VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART BECAUSE WARMIN CLIMATE IS THE DIRECT OR INDIRECT CAURSE FOR MANY OF THE VIOLATIONS AGAINST THEIR RIGHTS
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_3 SATS A JUDGMENT DAY BECAUSE SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING IN EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT MORE THAN EIGHTEEN TIMES IN DIFFERENT LARGE GROUPS WHAT THIS TRADE DEAL REALLY MEANS FOR US
20150210-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150210-12:38:08_6 AND THIS IS THE REASON FOR ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS VERY IMPORTANT DEBATE TO DAY BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO EMPLOYEES SHARE OWNERSHIP AND EMPLOYEE FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION THE COMMISSION AND THE PARLIAMENT AS WAS MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM E P P EARLYE ON HAS BEEN TALKING A LOT
20130311-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130311-18:14:05_1 IT IS EVIDENT THAT GENDERAIQUALITY MUST BE MAIN STREAMED IN ALL POLICY RESPONSES TO THE CRISIS IN ALL EDUCATION AND TRAINING POLICIES IN THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL FUND AND IN OTHER PROGRAMS SO AS TO ENABLE GREATER SOCIAL INTEGRATION THROUGH EMPLOYMENT
20180118-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180118-10:27:06_0 HO MADAME PRESIDENT COMMISSIONER WE ALL KNOW THAT NIGERIA IS A HUGE COUNTRY THE MOST POPULATED COUNTRY IN AFRICA AND WE ALL KNOW THAT IT'S DEVASTATED BY INJUSTICE AND VIOLENCE NOT ONLY ON RELIGIOUS GROUNDS BUT ALSO ON SOCIAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL GROUNDS
20170426-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170426-16:44:25_6 NOW THE ONLY THING THAT COMES TO MIND TO ME IN ALL THIS CONTEXT IS IF ALL FOREIGN INFLUENCE IS SO BAD WHY DO YOU ACCEPT THE PAYMENT OF FIVE BILLION UROS ANNUALLY AS THE BIG NET RECIPIENT OF EUROPEAN STRUCTURAL FUNDS IN ORDER TO PLASTER THE WHOLE COUNTRY WITH THE POSTERS IN WHICH YOU CALL BRUSSELS CRAP
20150910-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20150910-11:06:41_1 AND WE ARE WORRIED BY THE DETERIORATING SITUATION WHEN IT COMES TOH RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS PERSECUTION OF POLITICAL OPPONENTS AS WELL AS JOURNALISTS IS BECOMING A RULE IN THIS COUNTRY FULL OF CONTRAST A COUNTRY WHICH IS ON THE ONE HAND INCREDIBLY RICH IN OIL AND DIAMONDS AND ON THE OTHER HAND HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF CHILD MORTALITY IN THE WORLD
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_16 I BELIEVE IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT WE MAY FIND DIVISIONS OF LABOR APPLICATIONS OF JOINT EXPERTIES AND THE NECESSARY MECHANISMS OF COROPORATION INCLUDING COMMON STANDARDS WHICH YOU HAVE CALLED FOR
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_2 IT WOULD BE DEEPLY SAID IF IN THE FIFTH YEAR OF THIS LEGISLATURE WE WERE TO FIND OURSELVES CURNING OUT YET ANOTHER RESOLUTION ON THE SINGLE MARKET AND DEBATING THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE FIRST YEAR AMONGST OTHERS THE FRAGMENTATION AND INADEQUATE APPLICATION OF ROOFS
20170703-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170703-18:28:03_8 I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE THE MOREDOVERN AUTHORITIES TO TRULY REACH OUT TO THE OPPOSITION AND TO CIVIL SOCIETY AND ENGAGE IN THIS DISCUSSION ON THE ON THE E ER IF THE DISCUSSION CONTINUES ON THE MODEA TRANSFORMATION OF THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM BUT I ALSO ENCOURAGE THE OTHER PARTIES TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION FOR DIALOGUE
20180418-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20180418-13:38:40_0 A THANK YOU SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY SEEMS TO BE THE PAST  AND PRESIDENT MUCKRON ER IF WE LET HIM DO SO WE'LL CHANGE THE STRUCTURE AND THE STRATEGIES AND EVERYTHING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AR

20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_4 WE'VE SEEN RECORD ACTIVITY ON THE PART OF THE COMMISSION IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH HARD CALL CARTELLS WE'VE SEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LENIENCY SYSTEM WE'VE SEEN RECORD FINDS AR PUT INTO OPERATION BY THE COMMISSION AND WE'VE SEEN RECORD ACTIVITY IN TERMS OF MERGES AND STATE AID NOTIFICATIONS AS WELL
20180206-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180206-18:02:41_1 AND IT IS IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGIN BUT ALSO FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION ITSELF BECAUSE WITHOUT PROVIDING A CREDIBLE PERSPECTIVE FOR FULL MEMBERSHIP FOR ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WESTERN BALCANS THE EU GLOBAL ROLL WILL NOT BE CREDIBLE BECAUSE THIS IS OUR REGIN THIS IS OUR FIRST COMMITMENT
20180207-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180207-18:15:09_0 IN THE MEMBERS OF THE SOCIALIST AND DEMOCRATIC FAMILY IN THIS HOUSE WE DO TRULY CARE ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW SEPARATION OF POWER AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIALY AND OF COURSE WE UNDERSTAND LEGITIMATE CONCERNS EVERY TIME THERE IS A RISK O BREACH OF THE RULE OF LAW REGARDING A JUDICIAL REFORM IN A MEMBER STATE
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_11 OF COURSE THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD HELP US TO REDUCE THESE TRANSACTION COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LONG RUN AND I THINK IF WE REGULATE WELL WE MIGHT EVEN HAVE A OPEN ACCESS ELECTRONIC WALLETS WHERE THE TRANSFER FUNDS WOULD BE DECIDED BY SOME SORT OF LEATZ COST ROUTING
20171113-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20171113-22:24:11_20 INCLUSION IN ANY FOREIGS BIREEDS RESENTMENTS CONFRONTATION EXTREMISTS AND SOMETIMES VIOLENCE INTEGRATION ON THE OTHER HAND IS A PROMISE OF STABILITY AND OF PEACE NOT TO MENTION THE ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION THAT MIGRANTS USUALLY YOUNG PEOPLE CAN BRING TO AN AGIN POPULATION
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_0 MISTER PRESIDENT WHAT WORRIES ME MOST IS THE SUGGESTION THAT THE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK HAS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE TO PLAY IN SOLVING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS THAT IT CAN SOMEHOW ACT AS THE EUROPE WIDE BODY TO PROVIDE STIMULUS WHERE MEMBER STATES HAVE SINGULARLY FAILED TO COORDINATE THEIR OWN STIMULI
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_30 IN THOSE AREAS THAT CANNOT BE QUALIFIED AS STOP POLITICAL PRIORITIES IN THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES REDUCTIONS IN THE PROPOSAL OF THE COMMISSIONER APPLIED IN A CAREFUL FASHION IN ORDER NOT TO HARM PROGRAMMES THAT PERFORM WELL AND ARE COMING UP TO SPEED
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_13 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WHEN THE COMMISSION GIVES ITS APPROVAL ITS GIVING THAT APPROVAL IN WAYS WHICH ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE TREATY AND DO NOT CREATE SUCH SIGNIFICANT MARKET POWER IN FUTURE THAT THAT BECAM BECOMES A SCENARIO FOR ABUSE IN ITS OWN RIGHT
20150429-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20150429-22:59:14_8 A MEASURE THAT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY FACILITATE UNBLOCKING THE SITUATION IS A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL BY THE COMMISSION TO ADOPT THE ILLEGAL FRAMEWORK TO THE MARACIS TREATY AHEAD OF THE COUNCIL DECISION ON THE CONCLUSION OF THE MARCIS TREATY
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_10 IT WAS INITIALLY EXPECTED THAT EMA'S REGISTERED COMPANIES WOULD HAVE PERFORMED BETTER EM SINCE THE EMA'S ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS ARE TOUGHER AS COMPARED WITH OLDER AND BETTER KNOWN CERTIFICATES SUCH AS ISO
20130610-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20130610-19:01:06_2 IN THIS RESPECT WE WELCOME ALL EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN COMMON SAFETY STANDARDS TO PUT IN PLACE VIGOROUS PROTECTION MEASURES STRICT CONTROLS AND TRAINING IN SAFETY PROCEDURES AS WELL AS FOR ENFORCING REGULAR RISK ASSESSMENT AND PREVENTING MEASURES BY EMPLOYERS
20150427-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20150427-22:24:17_5 THERE ARE ALREADY COUNTRIES IN THE PROCESS WHOSE POLITICAL SYSTEMS GIVE LESS THAN FULL THROATED SUPPORT TO THE DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS AND PLURALITY NEEDED FOR EFFECTIVE UNIVERSITY SECTOR AND THE ADMISSION OF BELLERUSE WOULD GIVE EVEN MORE CAUSE FOR CONCERN OVER THE CONFIDENCE WE WANT TO HAVE IN THE PROCESS
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:43:11_7 AND IAM ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED WE CANNOT JUST SAY THERE ARE NEW TASKS WHICH HAVE TO BE FUNDED AND AT THE SAME TIME WE CANNOT FIND SAVINGS IN THE EXISTING BUDGET AND THAT IS THE PLEA I AM MAKING HERE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT ALL THE MEMBER STATES HAVE TO DO AND JUST SAYING WE HAVE TO GO TO LON
20090204-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090204-09:07:32_1 FIRST OF ALL LET ME CONGRATULATE THROUGH YOU THE TEMPORARY COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHANGE FOR ALL THE WORK THAT IT HAS ACCOMPLISHED SINCE ITS CREATION IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN HEARINGS CONFERENCES REPORTS RESOLUTIONS EXCHANGES WITH THIRD PARTIES
20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_8 WE ALL KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT GET A FULL LEGALLY BINDINGAGREEMENT WITH REGARD TO MITIGATION IN DURBAN THAT WILL SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS BUT WE KNOW ALSO THAT WE HAVE POSSIBILITIES TO PURSUE TARGETS THAT ARE AMBITIOUS NONE THE LESS TARGETS THAT WILL GALGUETE US CLOSER TO OUR FINAL GOAL
20151028-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20151028-17:37:47_4 AND IT IS REALLY VERY DIFFICULT TO COME INTO THE SOLUTION WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE THIS BORDER IS AND WHAT ARE THE GUARANTEES TO ATERCIDE THAT BORDER TO NATIONAL SECURITY AREA SO THAT WE REALLY CAN SAY OUR CITIZENS YES WE HAVE THE HIGH STANDARDS
20150430-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150430-09:30:09_4 SO THE TIME REALLY HAS COME FOR THE BANK TO ADOPT AN UP TO DATE RESPONSIBLE TAXATION POLICY AND THAT WOULD INVOLVE THREE MEASURES DURING THE EXERCISE OF THE BANK'S DUE DILIGENCE PARTICULARLY FOR INTERMEDIARIES WHICH AS MY COLLEAGUE OGOUBIER SAID ARE A PARTICULAR PROBLEM
20090204-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090204-09:07:32_11 AS FAR AS THE E T S IS CONCERNED A SINGLE E U CAP WILL WITH A LINERA DOWNWARD TRAJECTORY WILL BE SET AUCTIONING WILL BE GRADUALLY INTRODUCED AS THE METHOD OF ALLOCATING ALLOWANCES AND MORATORING REPORTING AND VERIFICATION WILL BE STRENGTHENED
20151215-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151215-22:31:33_5 I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THIS PRINCIPLE THEREFORE COMMISSIONER I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU TO NIGHT IF YOU THINK THAT THIS PRINCIPLE THAT A PERSON SHOULD RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE COUNTRY IN WHICH HE OR SHE HAS CONTRIBUTED SHOULD APPLY FOR NOT ONLY FRONTIER WORKERS BUT ALL MOBILE WORKERS WITHIN YOU THANK YOU
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_9 SO YES IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS HUGE TRANSITION WE WILL STILL NEED FOSSILE FUELS AND THEREFORE EVU POLICIES SHOULD SUPPORT CARBON CAPTURE ENABLE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT SCHEMES FOR BLUE HYDROGEN AND I EXPECT THE COMMISSION TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS DIRECTION IN ITS ENERGY SUMMER PACKAGE
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_14 A ALSO NOW AT THIS MOMENT DISCUSSING POSSIBILITIES OF REDUCTION OF PREDUCTION OF THE MILK PRODUCTION IN THE NETHERLANDS ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS AND I THING IT'S UP TO THE COUNCIL IN JUNE TO SEE HOW WE CAN SUPPORT THOSE INITIATIVES OF FARMERS ORGANIZATIONS TO REDUCE THE MILK PRODUCTION
20180528-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180528-18:19:03_6 AND THIRDLY AND FINALLY I DO REGRET THAT YOUR PROPOSAL FOR REGULATION ON ELECTRONIC FREIGHT TRANSPORT INFORMATION DID NOT COME A LITTLE BIT EARLIER IN THE FIRST MOBILITY PACKAGE BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE SERVED AS A SOLID LEGAL BASE FOR THE ENFORCEMENT PART OF THE LEX SPETTIALIS ON POSTING OR FOR THE CABOTAGE DIRECTIVE
20121119-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20121119-19:02:03_6 I THEREFORE ASK THE COMMISSION TO URGE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LOCAL PRIMARY HEALTH STRATEGY TO EMPRESS HEALTHY LIFE STYLE AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS AND THE EARLY INTRODUCTION OF SCREENING PROGRAMS ACROSS EUROPE SO THAT WE CAN MEET OUR GOALS OF HEALTHY AGING BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX
20180502-0900-PLENARY-29-en_20180502-22:29:15_2 AS THE REPORTER HAS STATED WE TACKLED VERY IMPORTANT TOPICS LIKE FAG NEWS WHISTLE BLOWERS GE BLOCKING AND LICENSES ALWAYS DEFENDING FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION WHICH IS THE CRUCIAL AND THE CENTRAL POINT OF OUR CONCERN
20160526-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20160526-10:37:48_2 WE NEED TO START WORKING TOWARDS A FAIRER SINGLE MARKET THAT IS POLITICALLY SUPPORTED ECONOMICAL RYVIABLE SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE BY EUROPEAN CITIZENS A MARKET THAT STIMULATES SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DROP CREATION BUT ALSO CONSIDERS CITIZENS HOPES FEARS AND EXPECTATIONS
20121119-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20121119-19:02:03_1 BREAING IN MIND THE GUIDE LINES FOR CHOLERACTA KANSAS SCREENING FROM TWO THOUSAND TEN LAST WEEK I HOISTED A CONFERENCE WITH A LAUNCH OF WHITE PAPER SETTING THE STANDARDS FOR THE PREVENTION DIAGNOSIS TREATMENT AND CARE OF CHOLERACTA CANSER ACROSS EUROPE
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_4 THIS MEANS THAT WE WISH TO FINANCE ADEQUATELGA INVESTMENTS TO SPARE GROWS AND JOBS FOR EXAMPLE THROUGH THE EUROPEAN FUND FOR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS AND TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO TACKLE THE STILL ONGOING MIGRATION CRISIS AND HELAGHTED EXTERNAL POLICIES
20180614-0900-PLENARY-en_20180614-12:20:00_7 SO IF INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT IS POSTING FROM DAY ONE COLLEGUE VOTING AGAINST CAN GO BACK HOME AND TELL TRIVERS THAT IN THE FUTURE THEY MIGHT NOT THRIVE WITH THEIR NATIONAL SALARIESANY MORE INSTEAD THEY COULD BE PAID FON A FINAL COUNTRY DESTINATION MINIMUM WAIGHTS
20170404-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170404-10:00:04_4 WITH THE NEW PROPOSAL WE ARE INTRODUCING NEW REAL DRIVING OMISSION TESTS THAT ARE CLOSEST TO THE REAL WORD USE AND WE WILL ALSO INTRODUCE NEW TYPE APPROVAL LEGISLATION ER THAT WILL HELP THESER CARS TO BECOME MUCH CLEANER BUT WE DON'T NEED NEW AGENCIES FOR THAT
20090324-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20090324-17:45:27_4 IF I COULD TURN TO A ACTIVITY BASE BUDGETING AND MANAGEMENT I THINK THE COMMISSIONERAS MADE HUGE PROGRESS ON THIS BUT I WOULD WARN AGAINST OVER BUREAUCRATIZING THIS  EXERCISE BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT TO INSURE IS THEIR QUALITATIVE EVALUATION NOT SIMPLY TICKING BOXES
20170704-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170704-10:02:25_5 IS THE POLICY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION FOLLOWING A DEMARTIS PRESIDENCY  THIS KIND OF PARADIME SHIFT IS WHAT MY COUNTRY HUNGARY HAS BEEN FIGHTING FOR FOR A LONG TIME AND WE SHALL NEVER GIVE UP
20150611-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150611-10:25:51_2 INDEED THE DESTRUCTION OF SUCH SIGHTS IS IN FACT CONTRARY TO ISLAMIC SCHOLARSHIP WHERE PREVIOUS CIVILIZATIONS AND THE LEARNING AND ARCHITECTURE OF ANTIQUITY WAS STUDIED PRESERVED OFTEN INCORPORATED AND IN A POSITIVE SENSE USED
20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_4 AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE ANTITERROR LEGISLATION WITH PROFILING AND YOU SEE IT CREATES INSECURITY AND IT CREATES PROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE THEIR DAILY LIVES AND YOU CANNOT COMBAT TERRORISM WITH ANTITERROR LAWS THAT CREATE THE SAME INSECURITY FEELINGS
20131007-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131007-20:14:10_9 SUCH PREVENTION PRESUPPOSES MAJOR COMMITMENT AS WELL AS SUSTAINED AND CONSESTED EFFORS BY THE COMMISSION BY NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS OF COUNTRIES EXPERIENCES SUCH PHENOMENON BY THE CIVIL SOCIETY INER NATIONAL AGENCIES AND OTHER STATE HALTERS
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_4 THE BALTIC SEA STRATEGY HAS REQUIRED A COMPLETE A COMPLETELY NEW APPROACH FOR THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ASIT AS IT IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAVE PREPARED AN INTEGRATED STRATEGY FOR A GROUP OF MEMBER STATES WHO HAVE TO FACE THE SAME CHALLENGES AND WHO MAY BENEFIT FROM THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES
20150325-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150325-20:56:20_4 SOME PEOPLE ARE CLAIMING THAT THE GERMAN APPLICATION OF THE MINIMUM WEGHGES IS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS ATTACKS ON THE SINGLE MARKET SINCE THE ADOPTION OF THE SINGLE MARKET ACT THESE PROTECTIONIST MEASURES CREATE BARRIERS ALL THE WAY DOWN EUROPE
20180315-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180315-15:04:13_21 TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTY EIGHTEEN THERE WE STAND AND NOW WE HAVE TO WAIT TILL TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO HAVE AN ENVELOVATION AND THEN THIS MONEYG THAT IS ALREADY IN THE ENVELOPE OF THE MEBERSTRATES CAN BE COMMITTED TO BE SPENT LATER IN TWOT
20131209-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131209-19:07:30_10 OUR CHOICE TO MORROW IS TO GO FOR A STRONG MANDATE WITH A BUN AND GO FOR NEGOTIATIONS OR GO FOR NEGOTIATIONS USING AS TA STARTING POINT OR MANDATE AND END UP WITH SOMETHING MEANINGLESS
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-16:34:02_6 SHE REPORTED ON THE PANAMA PAPERS AND WE HAVE SEEN WE HAVE READ WE HAVE HEARD AND WE COULD NOT IGNORE PANAMA PAPERS ARE DIRECTLY IMPLICATED WITH SOME MALTIS AUTHORITIES
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_15 IN ADDITION THE NEWLY ADOPTED LAW WAS SIGNED YESTERDAY BY THE PRESIDENT OF UCRANE I WELCOME THE REPORTER WELCOMES THIS NEWS WITH GREAT SATISFACTION IT MEANS THAT UCRANIANS TAKE THE COMMITMENT SERIOUSLY
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_17 IN ADDITION THE NEWLY ADOPTED LAW WAS SIGNED YESTERDAY BY THE PRESIDENT OF UKRANE I WELCOME HE REPORTER WELCOMES THIS NEWS WITH GREAT SATISFACTION IT MEANS THAT UCRANIANS TAKE THE COMMITTMENT SERIOUSLY
20170201-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170201-18:15:33_2 THE BEST WAY TO STOP THESE HUGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE ILLEGALLY COMING INTO EUROPE AND TO STOP THE LARGE NUMBERS OF TRAGIC DEATHS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IS SURELY TO TURN THE BOATS BACK AND PROCESS THE MIGRANTS OFF SHORE
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_9 NEVER HAS THERE BEEN A MORE IMPORTANT TIME FOR MEMBER STATES AND HE INSTITUTIONS TO REMAIN UNITED NEVER HAS THERE BEEN A CRUCIAL TIME FOR ALL OF US TO FOCUS ON THE BIG PICTURE AND SHUT OUT POTENTIALLY DISTRACTING UNNECESSARY DEVISIVE ISSUES
20090310-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090310-09:24:48_8 ONE MAIN WEAKNESS HOWEVER IN THE COMMISSION PROPOSAL AND THAT IS THAT THERE WAS NO PROVISION FOR THE SELLING OFF OF TIRES THAT DID NOT MEET THE NEW REQUIREMENTS AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE AND I BELIEVE THAT IS A MAJOR FLAW
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_4 OR TO BE DISPERSED AS MEDIUM AND LONG TERM BLOWNS THE ASSISTANCE IS ALSO INTENDED TO TRIGGER REFORMS IN UCRANE WHICH IS DONE BY AGREEING WITH THE UCRANIAN AUTHORITIES A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
20130911-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20130911-19:09:22_13 WE RECOMMEND ENCOURAGING THEREBY THE CIVIL SOCIETY INCLUDING TRADE UNIONS AND BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL AS THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION ALONGSIDE THOSE OFFICIALS TO INCREASE THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THER DIALOGUE ON MODERNIZATION
20150611-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150611-10:25:51_1 AS A FORMER UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SIGHTE CHAIRMAN MYSELF A THE THOUGHT THAT THIS WONDROUS JEWEL COULD BE DESTROYED CONCERNS ME AND SO MANY OTHERS DEEPLY NEVER FORGETTING THE PROBABLY OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN AND AROUND THE SIGHT
20101124-0900-PLENARY-26-en_20101124-12:25:01_4 WE WELCOME THAT BARONESS ASHTON THE HIGH REPRESENTATIVE IS ACTING IN A CONCERNED MANNER WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL ACTORS OUR ALLIES AND OUR STRATEGIC PARTNER THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA IN CONDEMNING THIS CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE UN COREAN ARMISTICE AGREEMENT
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_17 IMPARTIAL SYSTEM OF CERTIFICATION WILL BE WE SUPPOSE APPRECIATED ALSO BY CONSUMERS I HOPE THAT THIS WILL HELP ORGANIZATION TO CHOOSE THE MOST RATIONAL SYSTEMIC APPROACH IN ORDER TO INTERCONNECT DIFFERENT FIELDS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
20170315-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170315-22:06:27_8 I'M PLEASED THAT MANY OF THESE ARE REFLECTED IN THE REPORT COVERING TOPICS FROM INSURING MEDIA FREEDOM TO IMPROVING WORKING CONDITIONS FOR CIVIL SOCIETY TO BETTER ARRANGEMENTS FOR VICTIMS OF GENDER BASE VIOLENCE TO ELIMINATING OBSTACLES TO HEALTH CARE EDUCATION HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT FOR ROMAN PEOPLE
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_17 THIRD I TAKE THE UPEN PARLIAMENT'S VIEWS AS WELCOME INPUT TO THE EARLY STAGES OF THE E BO D FOURTH CAPITAL RESOURCES REVIEW WHICH WE WILL CONCLUDE AT OUR ANNUAL MEETING IN ZAGREB AND MAY
20130522-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20130522-19:21:16_2 LAST DECEMBER ONLY TWO MONTHS AFTER THE POSITIVE COMMISSION PROGRESS REPORT WE EXPERIENCED A MAJOR POLITICAL CRISIS IN THE FORMER YUGUSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA THE OPPOSITION WAS KICKED OUT OF THE PLENARY JOURNALISTS HAD BEEN EXPELLED PREVIOUSLY VOTING TOOK PLACE WITHOUT THEIR PRESENCE
20121022-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20121022-18:49:22_11 THIS IS EXACTLY THE AIM OF THE EUROPEAN YEAR OF CITIZENS TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN TO MARK THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNION CITIZENSHIP BY THE TREATY OF MASTRICHT AND TO GIVE A NEW MOMENTUM TO THE DEBATE ON UNION CITIZENSHIP
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_6 IT MIGHT NOT BE A SILVER BULLET BUT WE ALL AGREE THIS ENERGY CARRIER HAS ENORMOUS POTENTIAL AND OUR AIM IS CLEAR TO CREATE A NEW CLEAN PRODUCED GREEN HYDROGEN MARKET AND A LONG TERM CERTAINTY FOR ALL PARTIES INVOLVED AND THAT REQUIRES MASSIVE INVESTMENTS
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_12 ON FINANCIAL TERMS ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL FINANCEN FROM THE EW BUDGET THE STRATEGY PROPOSES A MORE COLORDINATED USE OF EXISTING FUNDS AND A MORE IMAGINATIVE APPROACH TO OTHER FUNDING SOURCES SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK OR THE NODING INVESTMENT BANK
20170703-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170703-17:34:14_16 THE OTHER TWO INSTITUTIONS HAVE ACCEPTED ONE HUNDREDH PER CENT OF OUR REQUESTS THE AGREEMENT REACHED DURING THE TRILOGUE ALSO INCLUDES A JOINT STATEMENT BY H EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMISSION RECALLING THAT HE NECESSARY PRE CONDITION FOR THE DISBURSEMENT OF THE ASSISTANCE IS TO RESPECT OF EFFECTIVE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_8 FOR THE NEW STRATEGY I THINK THAT FINANCIAL INVESTIGATIONS AN ACTION AGAINST MONEY LUNDERING NEED TO PLAY A BIGGER PART IN FIGHTING TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS AND TO INSURE THAT CONFISCATED ASSETS ARE USED TO SUPPORT AND COMPENSATE VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING
20110406-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20110406-11:07:32_0 MISTER PRESIDENT IN MAY TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT VOTED FOR THE SINGLE MARKET TO BE PERCEIVED AS A HOLISTIC UNIFIED PROJECT FINDING AN EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN AN OPEN AS SEMI FRIENDLY ECONOMY AND A CITIZEN'S SOCIAL AND BASIC RIGHTS
20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_10 THIS MEANS USING IT TO OPPOSE BLOCK AND EVEN VETO BEHAVIOR ON INTERNATIONAL TREATIES CONVENTIONS AND AGREEMENTS WHICH ARE AGAINST OUR INTEREST THERE IS A CLEAR YU KA MESSAGE HERE FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION YOU' THINK HE HAULED ALL THE CARDS
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-20:08:31_4 EITHER WE DEVELOP A I BASED ON OUR OWN VALUES AND WITH THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OR WE ENTER USING A I DEVELOPED ON OTHER CONTINENTS WE DOUBT THOSE VALUES AND WE DOUBT A LARGE PART OF THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS
20170913-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170913-11:57:04_3 STOP BESHING HUNGARY STOP PREACHING US ABOUT SOLIDARITY AND TALK ABOUT SOLIDARITY TO THOSE STRONG HEALTHY YOUNG SYRIAN AND OTHER MEN  WHO SHOULD GO HOME AND REBUILD THEIR COUNTRIES
20090310-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090310-09:24:48_2 HER CAR WAS DESTROYED BUT SHE WALKED AWAY RELATIVELY UNHURT WHY BECAUSE THE CAR SHE WAS DRIVING HAD THE MOST MODERN SAFETY FEATURES AND THAT ENABLED HER NOT TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED
20121023-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20121023-22:06:22_7 TO INSURE THIS I INCLUDED A PROVISION THAT IF JAPAN HAS NOT DELIVERED ON ITS ANTIBI COMMITMENTS AND HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED SUFFICIENT AMBITION IN MEETING THE EUS PRIORITY DEMANDS THE COMMISSION SHOULD STOP NEGOTIATIONS AFTER CONSULTATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_14 WE SAY NO TO ALL FORMS OF PATRIARCHAL CONTROL OVER OUR BODIES AND WE SAY YES TO SEXUAL FREEDOM AND CHOICE FOR WOMEN AND FOR PROPER SEXUALITY EDUCATION WHERE WE CAN LEARN ABOUT OUR RIGHTS AND OUR WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND OUR BODIES AND ABOUT TITERIES
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_10 AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE TREND OF TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS BEING MIXED UP WITH OTHER LEGALLY DISTINCT CONCEPTS SUCH AS MIGRANT SMUGGLING INCREASINGLY ADDRESSING TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS THROUGH A SECURITY LENS FOR INSTANCE IN THE CONTEXT OF RECENT MIGRATION POLICIES
20090324-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20090324-22:20:58_3 CONSUMERS ARE INCREASINGLY SENSITIVE ABOUT SUFFERING AND INJURIES OF FARM ANIMALS AND THEREFORE THEY HAVE RIGHT TO BE INFORMED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF CLONING TO CAUSE PAIN AND TO WASTE NATURAL RESOURCES
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_3 IN OTHER WORDS IT IS A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT AND ITS PURPOSE IS ECONOMIC STEBILIZATION THIS IS THE FIRST TE FOURTH TIME THAT A COMMISSION PROPOSES AN M F E FOR UKRANE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR INTO
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_1 THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS LONG OVERDUE AND EAGERLY AWAITED BY BOTH CITIZENS WITH DISABILITIES AND OUR INCREASING AGING POPULATION WHO FIND THEMSELVES MORE AND MORE ISOLATED AND EXCLUDED FROM A WORLD WHERE INFORMATION IS ACCESSIBLE PRIMARILY ON LINE
20171025-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171025-15:58:29_1 YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SET THE AGENDA OR FRAME OUR POLITICAL RESPONSES LET ALONE FRAME OUR FUTURE YOU SHOULD STOP PUTTING PEOPLE AGAINST EACH OTHER AND STOP LYING ABOUT MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES AND SHOULD STOP CONFUSE MIGRANTS AND TERRISTS
20121022-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20121022-18:49:22_10 AT TIMES OF ECONOMIC POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CRISIS ONLY TWENTY MONTHS BEFORE THE NEXT EUROPEAN ELECTIONS PUTTING UNION CITIZENSHIP AND PARTICIPATIVE DEMOCRACY AT THE CENTRE OF THE POLITICAL AGENDA IS ABSOLUTELY A CESSION
20160510-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20160510-19:29:15_3 AS THE SITUATION IN EUROPE HAS DETERIORATED DRAMATICALLY I THINK THAT THE NEW SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS SHOULD TAKE A STEP FURTHER AND ADOPT STRONG OBJECTIVES TO REFLECT THE ENORMITY OF THE CRISIS WHILE ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF MIGRATION INTHE COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_9 THE SECOND DIRECTION IS THE OPENNESS TO THE WORLD IT IS HA LEADERSHIP IT IS THE EFFECTIVE DECISION MAKING IT IS A GROSS AND FINALLY ALSO THE BRINGING OF WEALTH TO OUR UNION AND EACH AND EVERY NATION AND MEMBER STATE HERE IN EUROPEAN CONTINENT
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_34 THIS IS A TEST OF HOW WE HAVING OVER THE LAST SIXTY YEARS CREATED A EUROPE WHICH HAS SOCIAL PROTECTION AS WELL AS ECONOMIC PROGRESS CAN HELP SHAPE A WORLD WHERE WE HAVE ECONOMIC PROGRESS ENVIRONMENTAL CARE AND SOCIAL JUSTICE AT THE SAME TIME
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_35 OF COURSE A LOT OF THE THINGS IN THAT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNION AND THE MEMBER STATES AND TURKEY  HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH AND HAVE TO BER ELABORATED ON AND DHOSE INDIVIDUAL ASPECTS WILL OF COURSE WHEN IT'S LEGALLY BOUND TO BE DEALT WITH WITH THE PROPER INSTITUTIONS
20180418-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20180418-13:33:54_8 STILL IF WE WANT TO PROTECT EUROPE AND OUR COUNTRIES AND OUR OER COMMUNITIES TOGETHER HUNGARY THE VISHAGRAT COUNTRIES AND THE CITIZENRY OF EUROPE PLEASE SPEAK UP WHEREVER YOU CAN AND SUPPORT HUNGARY
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:32:20_5 FOUR HUNDRED MILLION NATIONALS OF MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT STATES TRAVELLING FREE WITH NO PASSPORT CHECK WITH NO BORDER CONTROLS AND WITHIN A SINGLE COUNTRY THIS IS WHAT EUROPEANS HAVE ACCOMPLISHED AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY PROUD OF IT
20090204-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090204-09:07:32_18 IN ADDITION TO THE SHIRT VISION FOR LONG TERM ACTION TO MITIGATION AND TECHNOLOGY AND ADAPTATION THE IDENTIFICATION OF APPROPRIATE MEANS FOR FINANCING EFFECTIVE AND LONG TERM CLIMATE POLICIES WILL BE KEY IN THE EU FURTHER DELIBERATIONS
20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-16:26:52_11 AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE HAVE TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY AHEAD OF TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TO BE VERY FIRM ON OUR PRINCIPAL GROUND IT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF PEOPLE TO BE PEOPLE PEOPLE PEOPLE FIRST AT TECHNOLOGY FOR PEOPLE
20150907-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20150907-18:47:26_6 UPHOLDING THESE VALUES IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE FOR THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE THEY GUARANTEE THAT MEMBER STATES FULFIL THEIR INTERNATIONAL LOW OBLIGATIONS AND THAT THEY CAN TRUST EACH OTHER AND THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION

20090324-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090324-09:38:50_4 THEY MUST ALSO BE USED TO BRING IN PRIVATE FINANCE THIRDLY BECAUSE AT DIFFERENT APPROACHES FROM DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A LOOK AT WHETHER IT 'IS FEASIBLE TO HAVE AN EU FRAMEWORK FOR NON BANK MICO FINANCE INSTITUTIONS
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_21 HAVE BEEN DYING IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR FOR OUR FREEDOMS AND LIBERTIES AND ALSO NOW WHEN EUROPEAN UNION ARE FACING SECURITY CHALLENGES AT ITS EXTERNAL BORDERS CANADIAN SOLDIERS AGAIN ARE ON OUR SANDY BEACHES IN NORTHERN EUROPE
20131210-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20131210-16:02:42_4 IT IS ALSO A MOMENT OF TRUTH FOR OUR POLICY IN THE EASTERN NEIGHBORHOOD AND I WOULD DARE TO THE BIGGEST TEST THEATE OF THE EUS PERFORMANCE AS A GEO POLITICAL ACTOR CAPABLE OF DEFENDING ITS INTERESTS AND VALUES IN THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_24 WE I THINK I SHOULD REPRASE THAT MOST OF US BELIEVE IN A FUTURE EUROPE THAT UPHOLDS THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUE OF SOLIDARITY ON ISSUES LIKE MIGRATION AND IN A EUROPE THAT STRIVES TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF ITS CITIZENS
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_34 WE HAVE A FRAGILE BALANCING ACT TO FOLLOW A BALANCE BETWEEN FLEXIBILITY WHICH IS NOT SO LOOSE AS TO THREATEN THE MEANING OF A REAL UNION AND AN TRANSCENDENT RIGIDITY WHICH WOULD UNDERMINE THE WHOLE PROCESS OF THE EUROPEAN PROJECT
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-15:10:37_2 HIGH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SUSPECTED OF BEING IMPLICATED ALSO IN THE SAME OPERATIONS AND POLICE AUTHORITIES REFUSING TO INVESTIGATE THOSE ALLEGATIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN APPOINTED BY AN HALV ECONOMIC AND PERSONAL TIES WITH THE GOVERNMENT
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-15:47:14_4 BUT A SIMILAR CONCERN AND H WISH FOR DIALOGUE IN RELATION TO SPAIN IS NOT SHOWN BY THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS IN SPITE OF HAVING THERE MORE THAN STRONG SIGNALS OF BREACHES OF THE RULE OF LAW OF DEMOCRACY AND OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_3 FOR US TO SIT APART TO BE ALOOF  NOT TO CO OPERATE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IS A RECIPE FOR FAILURE AND FOR AN INABILITY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT IS ACTUALLY A GLOBAL BANKING FAILURE THAT IS SPREAD ACROSS THE INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_1 THIS RESOLUTION IS A CALL FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH BUT IN MY OPINION IT IS ALSO AN INDICATION OF THE FRUSTRATION WHICH PARLIAMENT AND PERHAPS ALSOOF THE COMMISSION IS EXPERIENCING WITH A VERY EFFECTIVE COMPLETION OF THE SINGLE MARKET
20121212-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20121212-12:36:57_18 RIGHT AT THE MOMENT MY FEARS TO GO BEYOND CONS CONCERNS ABOUT BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS I FEAR WAR AND I WANT TO DEPICT A VISION THAT SPEAKS TO THIS FEAR
20160705-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20160705-18:52:45_1 WE HAVE A VERY INTENSIVE FIFE MONTS BEHIND US BUT I AM REALLY PROUD TO HAVE BEEN A PART OF THIS PROCESS WE ACHIVED A LOT TOGETHER THIS REGULATION IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE EUROPEAN UNION CAN ACHIVE IF THERE IS A POLITICAL WILL
20170315-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170315-19:17:51_7 IT WOULD BE AN AGENCY WITHOUT TRANSPARENCY PARLIAMENTARY OVERSIGHT LET ALONE CONTROL WE ARE IN FULL SUPPORT OF CENTRALIZATION IT MAKES SENSE IN THIS FIELD BUT NOT IN THIS WAY WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTABILITY WHATSOEVER
20160510-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20160510-19:29:15_1 THE EU IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST PROVIDER OF DEVELOPMENT AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND WITH THE ADOPTION OF A JENDA TWENTY THIRTY LAST SEPTEMBER IN NEW YORK WE ALL COMMIT IT TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GULLS
20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_2 FOR ME PERSONALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS IN THIS REPORT ARE THE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE SUBSTANTIAL STRENGTHENING OF THE ECONOMIC SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEVELOPMENT DIMENSIONS OF THE UEN SYSTEM
20180117-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180117-12:13:13_5 ARE YOU AWARE THAT THIS WILL REINFORCE THE WEIGHT OF THE BIG STATES BECAUSE IT'S NATURAL THAT IN THE FIRST PLACES OF EACH LIST THERE WILL BE NATIONALS FROM THE BIGGER STATES AND THIS WILL SURPRAGISE THE POSITION OF IRELAND PORTUGAL
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_16 GLOBAL EUROPE THE COUNCIL UNDERTOOK A THOROUGH ANALYSIS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY SPACE FOR CREATING THE NECESSARY MARGIN SINCE THE COMMISSION'S PROPOSAL FOR TWO THOUSEND SEVENTEEN HAS COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED THE MARGIN FOR COMMITTMENTS
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_2 THIS I GUARANTEE WOULD CAUSE IMMENSE DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WOULD RESULT IN PUTTING MANY OF YOUR CITIZENS OUT OF WORK IF WHAT WE CALL IN THE U K CUTTING OFF YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE
20171002-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171002-19:45:50_2 PALLAN PARLIAMENT ALSO SAYS CLEARLY THAT IT URGES THE MEMBER STATES WHICH ARE ABSENT HERE NOT TO IMPOSE ANY OBLIGATION ON ECRIPTION PROVIDERS THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE WEAKENING OR COMPOSING OF THE SECURITY OF THEIR NETWORKS OR DEVICES SUCH AS THE CREATE CREATION OR FACILITATION OF BACK DOORS
20180910-0900-PLENARY-en_20180910-21:47:35_14 FINALLY THE COMMISSIONER RAISED AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF LANGUAGE LEARNING THROUGH PUBLIC EVENTS LIKE THE EUROPEAN DAY OF LANGUAGES ON THE TWENTY SIXTH OF SEPTEMBER AND THE NATIONAL AWARDS OF THE EUROPEAN LANGUAGE LABEL FOR INNOVATIVE LANGUAGE LEARNING PROJECTS
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_13 HOWEVER AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT MUST BE A MARKET WHICH IS CREDIBLE WELL UNDERSTOOD AND TRUSTED BY CITIZENS PROVIDING EUROPEANS WITH A REALISTIC AND HOLISTIC ACCING GROWTH PLANNED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A TRULY COMPETITIVE INCLUSIVE AND SOCIAL ECONOMY
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-10:48:45_3 THIS IS NOT HAVING A SINCERE CO OPORATION NOR IS IT UPHOLDING THE INTEGRITY OF WHAT AN EU CITIZENSHIP SHOULD MEAN CONVICTED OLIGARCHS AND CORRUPT BUSINESS MEN HAVE NOTHING TO DO HERE IN THE EU
20170705-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170705-11:22:54_2 THE LOGICAL ORDER OF THESE FOUR OBJECTIVES SEEMS CLEAR THE INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE EUROPE THAT STONIA WANTS TO PROMOTE AS THE FOURTH OBJECTIVE WILL BE CLOSER IF THE FIRST THREE OBJECTIVES ARE ACHIEVED
20150908-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150908-17:53:33_2 FURTHERMORE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT PART OF THE EGENDAR BEHIND THE IN OTHER RESPECTS UNOBJECTIONABLE URBAN POLICY IS DESIRABLE EITHER ESPECIALLY AND I QUOTE TO IMPROVE THE DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY OF THE EUROPEAN PROJECT
20180910-0900-PLENARY-en_20180910-21:47:35_2 IN HIGH LIGHTING THE COMPLEXITY BROUGHT ABOUT BY LANGUAGE DIVERSITY AND THE FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE OF LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES ON THE ROAD TO ACHIEVING LANGUAGE EQUALITY THE REPORT PROVIDES FOOD FOR THOUGHTS FOR DEVELOPING FUTURE ACTIONS

20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_10 BUT I MENTION THE CHANGE OF CONTEXT BECAUSE OF COURSE WE ALL RECOGNISE THAT SINCE THE REPORTS WERE PUBLISHED BY THE COMMISSION THE COMMISSION'S WORK IN TERMS OF STATE EIGHT PARTICULARLY HAS REALLY TAKEN ON A RATHER DIFFERENT DIMENSION
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_0 THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT A THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRODUCES ITS ANNUAL COMPETITION REPORT AND IT IS TRADITIONAL FOR THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT TO CAST ITS EYE OVER THE REPORT AND TO PRODUCE AN OWN INITIATIVE REACTION TO IT

20180312-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180312-22:30:11_2 THIS IS INDEED WHERE REGIONS AND CITIES SHOULD BE WHEN IT COMES TO FINDING SOLUTIONS FOR CLIMATE AND MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION THEY HAVE PROVED TO BE AMBITIOUS FORWARD LOOKING AND INNOVATIVE SO WE NEED ALL OF THEM ON BOARD

20140226-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20140226-18:14:37_4 FOR THIS REASON THE EUROPEAN UNION MUST PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE DETERIORATING HUMANRIHTE SITUATION OF THE RACITURKMENT NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS OUR DUTY BUT ALSO BECAUSE THIS SITUATION IS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH STABILITY IN THE LAGEL MIDDLE EAST REGION
20090505-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090505-09:58:21_4 SERVICE PROVIDERS SHOULD BE MADE T ACT IN A TRANSPARENT  MANNER AT ALL TIMES AND IF IN VERY EXCEPTIONAL CASES RESTRICTIONS TO ACCESS ARE REQUIRED THEY SHOULD BE FULLY ACCOUNTABLE IN JUSTIFYING THESE RESTRICTIONS

20121121-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20121121-19:54:34_1 WITH SAVAR CRIMINALS GETTING BETTER AT BREAKING INTO PROTECTED NETWORKS I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY REAL WAY TO WIN THE BATTLE IS TO HAVE PEOPLE WITH SIMILAR KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE FIGHTING AGAINST THEM
20170703-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170703-17:34:14_13 AND WE HAVE CLARIFIED THAT CONDITIONS ARE TO BE ATTACHED TO THE DISBURSEMENT OF EACH AND EVERY OF THE THREE INSTALLMENTS THAT BENCH MARKS SHOULD BE CLEAR AS REQUIRED BY THE EUROPEAN COURTS OF AUDITORS AND THAT THE ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED IF THE CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET

20170703-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170703-17:34:14_4 AND IN JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEENH THE COMMISSION HAS PROPOSED THE INSTRUMENT THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING TO DAY A MICRO FINANCIAL ASSISTANT PACKAGE COVERING APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE PER CENTS OR ONLY A QUARTER OF THE COUNTRY'S FINANCIAL NEEDS AS IDENTIFIED BY THE I M F
20141124-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141124-19:43:56_6 HOWEVER TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN SHOULD NOT BE A LOST YEAR AS REGARDS INVESTMENTS FROM THE FIVE EUROPEAN STRUCTURAL AND INVESTMENT FUNDS IN THIS CONTEXT I WOULD LIKE TO TABLE THE FOLLOWING QUESTION
20180312-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180312-22:11:27_12 I UNDERSTAND VERY WELL THAT SOME OF YOU MAY THINK THAT WE ARE DEMANDING TOO MUCH BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE ALL KNOW THAT CHALLENGE'S IN TEQUALITY OF GOVERMENCE HINDERS THE PERFORMANCE OF PUBLIC INVESTMENTS

20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_15 IN THE NEGOTIATIONS ON MY E U U N REPORT I FELT THAT THOSE WHO EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF SECURITY DIMENSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS WERE RELUCTANT TO STRENGTHEN THE OTHER PARTS OF THE U N SYSTEM
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_3 WOULD BE A SERIOUS ISSUE IF IT WERE TO GO BUST LIKE SOME OF OUR COMMERCIAL BANKS THE REPORT ER EVEN ENCOURAGES THE E I B AND THE COMMISSION TO INCREASE LENDING BY EXPERIMENTING WITH NEW INNOVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
20090421-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090421-17:43:34_5 I UNDERSTAND I HAVE A VERY GOOD CASE AND ALSO ALONG WITH THAT I HAVE GONE FOR INTERIG MEASURES WHICH MEANS THAT NO MONEY WILL BE PAYABLE UNTIL THE COURT HAS HEARD ALL THE EVIDENCE AND MADE THE APPROPRIATE DECISION

20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-10:12:09_11 BUT IT IS ALSO AN ACT OF TRUST AND AN OFFER OF PARTNERSHIP TOWARDS THE E INSTITUTIONS NOTABLY THE COMMISSION AND THE COUNCILS WITH WHICH WE WANT TO WORK TOGETHER FOR A BETTER TRADE POLICY AND TOWARDS CANADA WHICH IS A COUNTRY THAT SHARES OUR VALUES OUR OBJECTIVES AND OUR HOPES FOR A BETTER FUTURE
20180530-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20180530-16:50:04_13 AND MADAME COMMISSIONER I KNOW THAT THE COMMISSION HAS LIMITED MEANS OF ACTION IN THIS BUT CONDEMN THE PRACTICE PLEASE AS CLEARLY AND AS UNEQUIVOCALLY AS THIS HOUSE DOES BECAUSE ONLY THEN ARE WE GOING TO GET THE MORE RELUCTANT  MEMBER STATES TO REALIZE THAT WHAT THEY DO IS WRONG
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_22 SIXTEEN THE COUNCIL PROTECTS AND SUPPORTS THE BUDGET FOR INSTRUMENTS THAT SPUR GROWTH AND THEREBY CREATE JOBS NAMELY SUCH INSTRUMENTS AS IEFESA COSME ERASMUS PLAS AND OTHERS

20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_22 YET THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE E I B AND WITH THE OPINE UNION IN MEETING OUR COMMITMENTS BOTH TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND TO OUR COUNTRY'S OF OPERATIONS IS CLEARER THAN EVER
20110509-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20110509-21:33:24_1 I BELIEVE THAT THIS OPPORTUNITY SHOULD BE USED BY THE PARLIAMENT TO STRONGLY SUPPORT AN AF T A WITH JAPAN FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS THE EUROPEAN UNION AND JAPAN ARE INDUSTRIAL GIANTS THAT SHARE DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND TOGETHER REPRESENTH

20170201-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170201-18:15:33_6 ONLY TO DAY WE HAVE BEEN WARNED BY THE ITALIAN OFFICIALS THAT GIADISTS ARE ACTUALLY PLUGGING THE GAPS IN FUNDING FOR THEIR ACTUAL CAMPAIGN BY SMUGGLING PEOPLE INTO EUROPE BECAUSE THEIR OIL MONEY IS RUNNING OUT
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_11 THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACTION PLAN WILL REQUIRE REAL CO OPERATION COMMITMENT AND LEADERSHIP FROM MEMBER STATES AND OREGINAL STAKEHOLDERS TO DELIVER THE EIGHTER OR SO PROJECTS INCLUDED AT THIS STAGE

20170118-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170118-15:42:09_2 CERTAIN POLITICIANS WHOM I DON'T HAVE TO NAME HERE IN THIS SPEECH SHOULD HANG THEIR HEADS IN SHAME BECAUSE OF THEIR DANGEROUS AND RECKLESS POLICIES WHICH HAVE ALLOWED GIHADES TO CROSS OUR BORDERS FREELY WITHOUT CHECKS
20171025-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171025-09:28:48_16 HAVE TO DELEATE THE DATA AFTER THE EXIT UNLESS THERE IS A RISK OR TE ER A SUSPICION SO WHAT WE EXPECT FROM THE CANADIAN AUTHORITIES WITH REGARD TO OUR CITIZENS WE SHOULD ALSO RESPECT WITH REGARD TO CITIZENS OF OTHER SAID COUNTRIES LIKE CANADA
20150908-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150908-17:53:33_0 I GIVE A CHAIRMAN AN A T C R GROUP RECOGNIZES THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDING AND SUPPORTS EFFORTS TO INSURE IT SPENT MORE EFFICIENTLY THIS SIXTH REPORT CLEARLY CALLS FOR MORE TO BE DONE THERE IT IS NOT A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH
20151014-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20151014-17:52:50_1 WHEN DISCUSSING THE FUTURE ACTIONS AIMED AT KEEPING THE RISING LOVEL AVERAGE TEMPERATURE BELOW TWO DEGREES ABOVE PRE INDUSTIAL LEVELS WE CANNOT IGNORE THE FACT THAT THE LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ARE NOT ABLE TO COVER THE COURSE OF NECESSARY INVESTMENTS IN CLEANER THECHNOLOGIES
20170517-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170517-15:31:36_9 SO INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY BLAMING AND CRITICISING ESPECIALLY PERSONALLYS SOME PEOPLE AT E CI B WE SHOULD APPRECIATE WHAT THEY DID FOR THE WAY HOW OUR ECONOMY HAS GOT OUT OF THE CRISIS FOR THE JOBS THEY SAVED ACTUALLY IMPROVED THE SITUATION IN EUROPE
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-08:34:44_8 AND IT OFFERS US NEW CHALLENGES A THAT ARE MORE MANAGEABLE THAN THE OLD ONES THAT WE HAD TO FACE LAST YEAR BUT THEY ARE STILL CHALLENGES AND THEY STILL LEAD TO A LOT OF WORK AND A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT THAT WE ARE DOING ON A DAY BY DAY AND WEEK BY WEEK BASIS
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_1 AND A LOT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID ABOUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE RIGHT'S VIOLATIONS AND ABOUT THE RELEVANCE OF THE TOPIC TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS BASED AND VICTIM CENTERED APPROACH

20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:34:51_14 THIS IS ONE OF THE CASES BECAUSE IT SHOWS INJUSTICE TO TOO MANY EUROPEAN CITIZENS AND NOW THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL HAS TO DO ITS JOB WHICH IS NOT PERFORMED AND INJUSTICE HAS TO BE STOPPED
20180531-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180531-15:00:20_5 FIRST OF ALL WILL THEY ERE WILL THE COMMISSION OR THE HIGH REPRESENTATIVE ORDER A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER E EE FUNDS HAVE FINANCED EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THE ORGANIZATIONS WORE SEXUAL ABUSE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED
20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_4 THEN IF WE LOOK AT WHAT HAS ACTUALLY NOW BEEN PLEDGED BY THE SAME COUNTRIES THE COUNTRIES THAT NEED TO CHANGE FUNDAMENTALLY WITHIN FIVE YEARS IT IS UNFORTUNATELY VERY VERY DISSATISFYING 
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-10:48:45_2 TO AM ONE OU COUNTRY PASSPORT ALSO MEANS THE ACCESS TO THE WHOLE E WITH ALL THE BENEFITS THAT TAKES YEARS FOR NORMAL PEOPLE TO ENJOY EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXEMPLARY HABITANTS
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_7 AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THE COUNCIL ALSO STATED THAT WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO AR QUOTA SYSTEM AND I AGREE WITH WHAT WAS SAID BY MISTER HAUTAMA THAT WE HAVE TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION OF THE FARMER IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_4 NOW THE PROBLEM IS HOW MODERN TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE USED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND HOW INDUSTRY OR SERVICES SHOULD BE HELPED IN PROMOTING THE ENVIRONMENTAL VALUE OF THE PRODUCTION
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_2 AND JUST LOOK AT THE POLITICAL DEBATES NO NUCLEAR ENERGY PLEASE NO CARBON CAPTURE THER UNTILS FOSSIL FUELS NO BAYOMASS NO GAS IN A TRANSITION NO WINDMILLS IN MY BACK YARD AND NO SOLAR PANELS ON AGRICULTURAL GROUNDS PLEASE
20170118-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170118-15:42:09_1 I I GET INTERESTED THAT THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE COUNCIL AT MEETING RAISE THE ISSUES OF MIGRATION AND SECURITY BECAUSE THESE TWO ISSUES GO HAND IN HAND AS HAS RECENTLY BEEN SHOWN BY THE ATTACKS ON OUR CONTINENT
20170913-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170913-11:27:02_3 WE SHOULD REALLY FOCUS ON POLITICAL PRIORITIES AND THE MAJOR PRIORITY IS HOW TO MOVE FROM EUROPE OF DIVERGENCE INEQUALITIES TOWARDS EUROPE OF CONVERGENCE AND STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SOCIAL JUSTICE
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:54:28_1 I AM VERY GRATEFUL THAT WE ARE WHERE WE ARE NOW ER INDEED EUKRAINE NEEDS THIS THE PORT AND IT DESERVES THIS SHEPORT AND I THINK IT IS VERY APPROPRIATE TO HAVE THIS AN NEXT PROGRAMM NOW
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:54:28_1 I AM VERY GRATEFUL THAT WE ARE WHERE WE ARE NOW ER INDEED EUKRAINE NEEDS THIS THE PORT AND IT DESERVES THIS THE PORT AND I THINK IT IS VERY APPROPRIATE TO HAVE THIS A NEXT PROGRAMM NOW
20110509-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20110509-21:33:24_10 IN ADDITION WE WILL SUPPORT BY LATERAL SAFEGUARD MEASURES AS WAS THE CASE WITH THE SOUTH CAREER F T A TO AVOID SERIOUS INJURY TO THE SENSITIVE SECTORS SUCH AS AUTOMOTIVES ELECTRONICS ARIATION AND MACHINERY
20180416-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180416-21:37:08_10 BECAUSE THE PATRONIZING ATTITUDE THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST HAS MADE US LOOK SECOND OR THIRD IN LINE IN TERMS OF PREFERENCE OF MANY RECIPIENT STATES AND THAT AFFECTS THE NOTIONOF THE NOTIONAL VALIDITY OF THE PARTNERSHIP AS WELL
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_12 AND I THINK WHAT WE ARE GOING M TO ACHIEVE WITH THAT EM PROGRAMM IS FIRST ALL WE'RE GOING BACK WE'RE TACKLING THE BIG CHALLENGES WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE ORDINARY LIFE OF CITIZEN WE WAN
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-15:50:40_2 I LIKE TO ASK THE COMMISSION AND THE GREEK GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE APPROVED LEGISLATION FULL IMPLEMENTATION ON EU LAW WILL GENERATE CONVERSIONS IN THE QUALITY OF RE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK WITH THE BEST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
20121022-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20121022-18:49:22_21 IN VIEW OF THE FORTHCOMING EUROPEAN ELECTIONS WE MUST RAISE AWARENESS ON THE LEGISLATIVE POWERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND ENCOURAGE CITIZENS TO VOTE SO THAT THEIR VOICE IS HEARD CLEAR BY YUN DECISION MAKERS
20180704-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180704-15:50:40_2 IULD LIKE TO ASK THE COMMISSION AND THE GREEK GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE APPROVED LEGISLATION FULL IMPLEMENTATION NON EU LAW WILL GENERATE CONVERSIONS IN THE QUALITY OF RE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK WITH THE BEST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
20150429-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20150429-11:27:20_3 IAM SURE THAT THIS QUEST FOR FREEDOM IS UNIVERSAL AND THAT THE YU HAS A MORAL OBLIGATION AND A STRATEGIC INTEREST TO AVOID MORE TRAGEDIES IN THE MEDITERRANEAN BY PROMOTING PEACE SECURITY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN A MORE FIRM AND ASSERTIVE WAY IN THE COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN
20130314-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20130314-15:35:00_6 THEREFORE THE EYO SHOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH THE ERACHIC GOVERNMENT AND USE ALL THE TOOLS AN IT AT ITS DISPOSAL TO ENCOURAGE THE IRACHIC GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROTECTION TO THE TURKMEN AND HE OTHER MINORITIES
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_3 YET THE CRISIS ALSO MEANS THAT CO OPERATION BETWEEN PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IS NO LONGER JUST A POLICY DRIVEN ASPIRATION BUT A VITAL NECESSITY
20180531-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180531-15:00:20_8 THIRD BUT NOT LEAST WILL THE COMMISSION AND THE HIGH REPRESENTATIVE CONSIDER WORKING WITH MEMBER STATES SUCH AS THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE NETHERLANDS TO SET UP CONTACT POINTS IN THIRD COUNTRIES INCLUDING IN CRISIS SONS FOR VICTIMS VICTIMS OF ABUSE
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_5 I DO HOWEVER HAVE A SOLUTION TO PREVENT GIBRALTAR BEING USED AS A PAWN IN BREXET NEGOTIATIONS AND INDEED END SPANISH CLAIMS ONCE AND FOR ALL MAKE GIBRALTAR A FULLY INTEGRATED PART OF THE UKA
20180228-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180228-18:17:01_4 HOWEVER I DEEPLY REGRET THAT THE COUNCIL DID NOT INCLUDE A REFERENCE TO THE U N BINDING TREATY ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS WHICH IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT NORMATIVE PROCESS CURRENTLY ONGOING
20090203-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090203-09:54:38_2 IT'S A WONDERFUL AM SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR ALL OF US AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE PART OF OUR LIVES INTO THE FUTURE HOWEVER THERE ARE THOSE WHO PREY ON CHILDREN AND THEY WILL USE THE INTERNET AN AS MUCH AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN TO TRY AND UNDERMINE CHILDREN
20171212-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20171212-23:01:40_1 AND THIS ANNUAL REPORT CONCLUDES INCLUDES STRONG LANGUAGE ON THE SHRINKING SPACE FOR CIVIL SOCIETY INCLUDING THE CALL FOR AN AU MONITORING MECHANISM FOR CASES OF VIOLATIONS OF FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY AND ASSOCIATION
20171115-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20171115-15:54:16_1 ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF COMMUNISM IN PRACTICE EQUALS ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED MILLION VICTIMS IT WAS AND IT IS STILL A SYSTEM WHICH IS BASED ON TWO PILLARS VIOLENCE AND LIES
20180613-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180613-20:24:22_1 EVER SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION GOT STARTED WE SOCIALISTS HAVE FOUGHT ALL ALONG THE WAY AGAINST THE RECESSIVE AUSTERITY AND IN FAVOR OF A EUROPEAN BADGET IN ORDER TO FIGHT SOR SOCIAL EXCLUSION
20170313-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170313-18:46:20_4 SO ITS GREATEST DIRECTIVE TAKES ACTION TO IMPROVE PE TRANSPARENCY AS WELL AS IMPROVING MANY OTHER AREAS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE NOW BREXET CAN'T BE USED AS AN EXCUSE FOR PROGRESS ON THIS ISSUE TO BE RULED BACK PARTICULARLY IN BRITAIN
20170315-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170315-16:48:33_6 ALL INDUSTRY INITIATIVES HAVE TO FULLY COMPLY WITH THE INTERNATIONAL O A C D DUE DILIGENCE GUIDE LINES ELABORATED TO HELP COMPANIES RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS AND AVOID CONTRIBUTING TO CONFLICT FINANCING
20151027-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151027-21:03:25_1 RATHER IT'S FOCUSING ON COUNTRIES LIKE YOURS AND SITUATIONS LIKE YOURS SO THAT COHESION ACHIEVES SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND LIFTS PEOPLE OUT OF THAT SITUATION FOR THE BENEFIT OF EVERYBODY WITHIN THE E U ON A LIMITED BASIS NOT FOREVER
20110705-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20110705-11:13:29_8 THE INCLUSION OF COMPLEMENTARY ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS AS WELL AS A LIST OF SOCIAL COMMONI GROUNDS FOR THE RESTRICTION OR PROHIBITION OF THEIR N GOS BY MEMBER STATES WILL MAKE THIS REPORT MORE LEGALLY SOLED
20201008-0900-PLENARY-en_20201008-11:26:32_0 ER FIRST OF FORMAS I WANT TO THANK ALL MY COLLEAGUES FOR A GOOD CORPORATION THAT HAS MADE THIS RESOLUTION POSSIBLE AN URGENCY THAT TALKS ABOUT REAL PEOPLE'S LIVES BECAUSE OPPRESSION AND INJUSTICE ARE NOT ONLY WORDS
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_15 THE SCOPE ALONG WITH THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS AND MONITORING SYSTEMS REFLECTS THE BINDING OBLIGATIONS SET OUT IN THE U N ON THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND THE COMMITMENTS MADE IN THE DIGILAT AGENDA FOR EUROPE
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-16:35:19_4 BUT HAVING SAID THAT OUR GROUP IS ALSO DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE WE ESPECIALLY HERE IN THE PARLIAMENT ALL OF US ARE ELECTED TO PREPARE THE FUTURE OF EUROPE AND THAT MEANS GETTING INTO THE CONCERNS OF EUROPE AND YOU KNOW VERY WELL WHAT THEY ARE
20090421-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090421-17:43:34_3 ALL I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT ER THE AR BIG FUSS AND BOTHER ABOUT MY PARLIAMENTARY ASSISTANE EXPENSES ER AND COVERED BY THE MEDIA OVER THE LAST NINE OR TWELVE MONTHS IT'S BEEN A HARROWING EXPERIENCE
20170118-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170118-15:42:09_7 I AM ALSO CONCERNED THAT THERE WAS NO MENTION OF IMMEDIATE IMIGRATION CONTROLS WHICH MEANS THAT BY THE TIME WE ARE FULLY OUT OF THE EU ON CURRENT RENDS WE COULD HAVE ANOTHER MILLION PEOPLE COMING TO OUR COUNTRY FROM THE CONTINENT
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_9 THEREFORE THE WORK OF THE MARKET TASK FORCE INSTALLED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS SO IMPORTANT AND IN THE JUNE COUNCIL WE WILL HAVE A FIRST REPORT OF THIS TASK FORCE AND HOPEFULLY WE GET SOME INTERESTING AND CREATIVE IDEAS
20090219-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090219-09:28:09_0 AFER FER SREMUKY MADAM PRESIDENT IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT WE'RE SITTING HERE TO DAY DISCUSSING MINOR CHANGES TO THE RULES FOR VALUE ADDED
20180116-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180116-20:56:23_8 IN CONCLUSION TO ALL THAT WORK I CAN SHARE THE E P P GROUP'S VIEW THAT WE SEE SANCTIONS AS A LAST RESORT MECHANISM AND WOULD APPRECIATE TURNING TOWARDS MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM ER AT HAND
20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-16:26:52_1 I SUPPOSE AND I AM SURE THAT IT'S NOT THE END O DISCUSSION IS NOT BEGINNING A DISCUSSION BECAUSE IT IS REALLY A VERY COMPLICATED PACKAGE AND I DON'T THINK THAT ALL OF HOUR MEMBERS AVE READ THE FULL PACKAGE
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_6 ONCE AGAIN WE ARE DISCUSSING THE POTENTIAL OF THE SINGLE MARKET BUT THE CITIZEN IS TIRED OF THIS RHETORIC AND INSTEAD WANTS TO SEE THE REALIZATION OF THIS POTENTIAL BECAUSE THE SINGLE MARKET IS VERY VITAL FOR A EUROPEAN UNION
20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_5 IT IS IMPORTANT THAT FACE BOOKIS NOT ONLY DOING ADS AS THEY SAY IS THEIR BUSINESS MODEL BUT ALSO DELIVER FOR TRUST IN THA WAY OF DELIVERING SOLUTIONS AND ACTIONS IN THE WAY OF HOW THEY DO THEIR BUSINESS MODEL
20090204-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090204-09:07:32_12 OF COURSE THE EU HAS REPEATEDLY SAID THAT IT WILL NOT SETTLE FOR TWENTY PER CENT WE WANT TO GO FOR THIRTY PER CENT AND THEREFORE WE HOPE FOR AN AMBITIOUS GLOBAL AND COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT IN COPENHAGEN
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_4 IF THIS POTENTIAL IS TO BE REALIZED THEN WE MUST FIND WAYS OF TURNING THESE TECHNOLOGIES INTO A RESOURCE FOR ALL PEOPLE DESPITE THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES WHAT DOES IT MEAN
20170201-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170201-18:15:33_4 AND THAT IS WHY SIX EUROPEAN COUNTRIES NOW HAVE BEEN IN PRIVATE TALKS WITH AUSTRALIA ASKING THEM WHICH WAY TO WORK THINGS OUT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE E U WAY IS FAILING
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_27 YOUR BECKING IS CRUCIAL TO MAINTAIN WIDESPREAD VISIBILITY FOR A STRATEGY TO MAINTAIN HIGH LEVEL POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR A STRATEGY AND TO MAINTAIN PRESSURE ON THE MEMBER STATES AND ORIGINAL ACTORS TO DELIVER RESULTS
20201008-0900-PLENARY-en_20201008-11:26:32_9 TO DAVID ISAC AND HIS FAMILY I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE MANY FRIENDS IN THIS PARLIAMENT AND WE WILL NOT STAY SILENT UNTIL THE DAY DAVID ISAC IS BACK HOME IN SWEDEN IN SAFETY
20151027-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151027-21:03:25_0 UT QUITE DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN BRIEFLY BUT IT'S ABOUT NOT SHUFFLING MONEY AROUND FROM ONE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER AND NOT PARTICULARLY THAT LARGE SCALE RECIPIENT COUNTRIES GIVE MONEY TO THE COMMISSION THAT THE COMMISSION THEN GIVES THEM BACK AND TELLS THEM WHAT TO DO
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_26 AND THE CURRENT INDICATORS SHOW THAT WE HAVE ONCE AGAIN STARTED TO REGISTER SUCCESSES WE BELIEVE THAT THE UNION SHOULDB SHOULD BE ROBUSTLY POSITIONED TO SHAPE AND MANAGE BYTHEIR CLOBALIZATION NOT MERELY REACT TOV ITE
20150908-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150908-17:53:33_1 AND I AND OTHERS IN THE GROUP ARE NOT WHOLLY CONVINCED THAT THERE IS AS FULL AN UNDERSTANDING AS THERE SHOULD BE THAT THIS FUNDING IS NOT A REVENUE SUBSTITUTE NOR IS IT INTENDED TO BE FOR MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE CENTURY AS HAS BEEN THE CASE
20150624-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20150624-21:54:57_2 IT IS OBVIOUS FOR EVERYONE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS UNFAIR AND HAS A DEVASTATING EFFECT ON HONEST TAXPAYERS INCLUDING SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED ENTERPRISES THEREFORE I CANNOT SEE ANY REASON WHY NOT TO ACT IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE SITUATION
20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_3 WE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT PATTERNS OF TROPICAL DEFORESTATION ARE THE RESULT OF THE INTERACTION OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS WHICH VARY IN IMPORTANCE IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS
20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_1 POVERTY WAR BUT ALSO THE LACK OF FREEDOM AND BAD GOVERNMENTE IS WHAT MAKES DESPERATE PEOPLE TO UNDERTAKE DANGEROUS JOURNEYS IN THE SEARCH FOR A BETTER LIFE IN EUROPE AND DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION ITS PART IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE ANSWER TO THIS CHALLENGE
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_16 I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THIS IS NOT YET ANOTHER PROGRAMME THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTIONS AND TO THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY BUT ALSO TO THE WELL BEING OF THE EUROPEAN EUROPEAN CITIZENS
20170703-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170703-17:34:14_17 I HAVE COME UP WITH THIS PROPOSAL TO ADOPT THIS JOINT STATEMENT IN ORDER TO ADDRESS CONCERNS OF COLLEAGUES FROM THIS IN THIS IANA IN THE HOUSE REGARDING THE RECENT INITIATIVE BY THE AUTHORITIES TO CHANGE THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM IN THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVER
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_10 WE HAVE THIRTY YEARS TO RESHAPE OUR ENTIRE ENERGY SYSTEM AND WE CAN DO IT AND WE WILL FAIL IF WE DEMAND TO BE PERFECT BUT WE WILL DEFINITELY SUCCEED BY DOING IT AS GOOD AS WE CAN
20170913-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170913-15:26:10_6 AND IT'S NOT ONLY THAT IT'S ALSO THE OTHER CARS THAT HAS HAVE BEEN CHEATING AND THE DIFFERENCES IN THE DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES LIKE SOME OF THEM ARE MANDATORY THE OTHERS ARE VOLUNTARY SOME ARE ONLY ON THE NATIONAL CARMAN AR CAR MARKET AND OTHERS ARE DIFFERENT
20090204-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090204-09:07:32_22 I HAVE PRELIMINARILY PROPOSED H A HIGH LEVEL MEETING WITH THE U S REPRESENTATIVES AND THE E U COMMISSIONE COMMISSIONER DEMAS THE CHECK PRESIDENCY AND THE UPCOMING SWEDISH PRESIDENCY THAT MEANS TROKA
20090422-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20090422-21:33:05_6 I THINK THE COMMISSION NEEDS TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND COME UP WITH THE RIGHT PROPOSAL ONE THAT IS NOT JUST ABOUT A SUPPORTING PERFORMERS AND ARTISTS BUT THAT IN REAL AND PRACTICAL TERMS WILL DELIVER PRECISELY THAT
20121121-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20121121-16:23:27_16 OUR GROUP ARGUES THAT WE SHOULD INCREASE OUR AMBITIONS SO THAT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY WE WILL REDUCE OUR AMBISTIONS BY THIRTY PER CENT INSTEAD OF TWENTY AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTY WE ALSO NEED AN EQUALLY AMBITIOUS TARGET
20180206-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180206-11:12:41_3 MANY OF US HERE ARE CONVINCED THAT EUROPE THE UPIAN UNION HAS BEEN IN A PROTRACTED CRISIS DRAGGING ITS FEET AND HAUNTED BY NATIONALISM POPULISM AND EUROPHORMS AND YOU KNOW WHAT
20090309-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090309-20:05:45_12 AND IF WE WANT TO GET OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND GET EMPLOYMENT AND TO STABILIZE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IN OUR EACH INDIVIDUAL MEMBERO STATES WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO TRY AND SAVE THEM
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_6 WHEREAS THE UTILIZATION IS RAPIDLY GROWING LOWER OUR PARTNERS FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES CONTINUE TO LAG BEHIND LOSING THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY UTILIZE THEIR HUMAN CAPITAL TOWARDS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THEIR SYSTENABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
20171025-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20171025-20:19:02_5 THEY ARE OFTEN GEOBLOCKED AND HAVE TO PAY A HIGHER PRICE BECAUSE OF THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE OR TO PUT IT MORE PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THE TEMPORARY LOCATION BASED ON THEIR RIPE ADDRESS
20180312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180312-21:47:46_4 WE NEED TO SHARE INFO AND FOR THAT WE NEED ALL THE PLATFORMS WHERE WE CAN EASILY SHARE THE INFORMATION AND ALSO WHERE WE CAN SHARE THE BIG DATA WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT AH WITTY I C T
20170213-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170213-20:38:34_4 A FEW WEEKS AGO ONE TEAM MANNER RACING BECAME THE LATEST TO COLLAPSE AFTER ADMINISTRATORS COULDN'T FIND A BUYER SMALLER TEAMS IN F ONE ARE PUNISHED BY RULES THAT GUARANTEE BIGGER TEAMS PRIZE MONEY EVEN IF THEY FINISH LAST
20090422-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20090422-23:01:25_1 THIS MATTER IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE FROM EUROPE WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY IMPACTS ON ER THE USEFULNESS THE EFFICIENCY OF ROAD TRANSPORT IN ALL ITS FORMS
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:40:33_1 WE MUST STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH THE CRANE IN FACE OF THE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT POLITICAL AND TERRITORIAL CHALLENGES IT FACES BUT ALSO IN ITS PROCESS OF REFORMS AND ECONOMIC MODALIZATION
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_24 I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO REMIND THE COMMISSION THAT THE PARLIAMENT IS STILL AWAITING THE COMMISSION REPORT ON THE POSSIBILITY TO DEFINE AND ESTABLISH MINIMUM CRITERIA FOR THE CREATION OF AN EQUAL EU EQUAL LABEL FOR FISHERY AND AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS
20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-16:04:50_4 AND THEREFORE I AM VERY HAPPY THAT COMMISSIONER KING IS STARTING TO INVESTIGATE INTO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HUNDREDS OF SECURITY MEASURES WHICHH EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBERSTATES HAS ADOPTED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS
20171024-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171024-11:07:45_0 BPRESIDENT I HAVE THREE SHUCH THREE MESSAGES ONE FOR ALL COLLEAGUES ONE FOR PRESIDENT TUSK AND THE OTHER FOR THE COMMISSION AND I WILL BE VERY SHARP VERY LOUD AND VERY CLEAR
20180228-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180228-18:17:01_5 PLORE THAT THE U HAS NOT BEEN CONSTRUCTIVE IN THE PROCESS AND HOPE THAT THE YU WILL LISTEN TO THE REQUESTS BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND GIVE ITS FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT TO THE UN BINDING TREATY PROCESS
20090915-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090915-19:04:10_14 MONEY WILL MAKE OR BREAK THE DEAL WE NEED TO MOBILIZE PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND PROMOTE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A ROBUST INTERNATIONAL CARBON MARKET BUT SUBSTANTIAL PUBLIC FUNDING WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED
20171115-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171115-10:11:28_13 THAT IS THE THING THAT WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT BECAUSE THERE ARE THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF POLES PROBABLY AE HALF OF THEM MORE THAN HALF OF THEM THAT WOULD STILL MAKE UP A PRETTY BIG MEMBER STATE WHO WANT A FUTURE IN EUROPE
20170404-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170404-10:00:04_6 WE SHOULD USE THIS PERIOD TO PREPARE NEW DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOCUSING ON NEW INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD EUROPE'S POSITION OF BEING THE NUMBER ONE CAR MAKER IN THE WORLD
20170213-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170213-20:41:06_11 AND WHEN IT COMES TO REMEDIES MAY I SUGGEST THAT ALL COMPANIES SIT DOWN WIV THEIR TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTS TOGETHER WITH THE COMMISSION TO TRY TO FIND NON DISCRIMINATING FUTURE PROVEN REMEDIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH
20180206-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180206-19:24:43_2 THE LEGACY IS REPRESSION ISOLATION AND CORRUPTION AND THERE IS AN EXPECTATION ABOUT THE NEW TRANSITION GOVERNMENT ALTHOUGH IT'S CHARED BY A FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF MUGAVER HIMSELF MISTER ANGAWA
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_18 WE CANNOT LEAVE THIS OVER TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR WITHOUT OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT WE MUST KEEP THIS IN THE PUBLIC DEBATE AS A PRIORITY AND WE MUST REGULATE NO MATTER HOW TECHNICAL THESE FILES ARE
20120314-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20120314-11:27:22_3 LET ME BE CLEAR EUROPE AND INTEGRATION CAN INDEED TRANSFORM THE POLITICS AND ECONOMICS OF CANDIDATE COUNTRIES AS IT HAS DONE IN MY COUNTRY BUT IT CANNOT CONSTRUCT DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY OF STATES AND THEIR INSTITUTIONS
20180416-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20180416-22:53:12_26 MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT COITION POLICY REMAINS THE MAIN INVESTMENT POLICY FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT IT CARRIES ON SUPPORTING GROWTS AND IMPROVING THE CONDITIONS OF INVESTMENTS
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_9 THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED INDEED AS THE TITLE OF THE INITIATIVE REPORT WOULD SUGGEST FOR VIRTUAL RCURRENCIES AND IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE COST OF FINANCIAL TRANSACTION SIGNIFICANTLY
20180116-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180116-20:56:23_6 I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE EVO CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE ESSENTIAL FIELDS OF LABOR RIGHTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AMONGST OTHERS AND ALSO TROT ITS T S D CHAPTERS IN OUR F D A
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:34:51_3 THIS IS A VERY TANGIBLE EXPRESSION OF OUR SOLIDARITY OF THE FREEDOM AND UNITY OF EUROPEAN CITIZENS AND IT BRINGS A LOT OF ECONOMIC BENEFITS BUT NOT FOR EUROPEANS
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:43:11_9 SECONDLY ON MIGRATION I HERE TO DAY REACH OUT MY HAND TO ITALY BECAUSE I KNOW THATE THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT SITUATION
20120329-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20120329-10:32:56_4 THESE MEASURES WOULD CORRECTE CONSUMERS AND THE SEMIS NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF THE SINGLE MARKET THEREBY BOOSTING THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE MARKET AND REASSURING THE CITIZEN THAT DEYU WORKS FOR THEM
20121121-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20121121-16:23:27_1 AND IT CONCLUDED THAT SCIENCE TELLS US THAT IF WE DON'T FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY WE CONSUME AND PRODUCE ENERGY NOW WE RISK THAT WE WILL HAVE A TEMPERATURE INCREASE OF FOUR DEGREES WITHIN SIXTY YEARS
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_1 THE DANGER IS THAT IF IT EXPANDS ITS ACTIVITIES TOO FAR INTO SUA SUPPORTING COMMERCIAL BANKS AND GOVERNMENTS AS HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THEN ITS ENVIABLE HIGH CREDIT RATING MAY BE DOWNGRADED LIKE SOME OF OUR GOVERNMENTS
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_18 THING I THINK THAT COMES OUT FROM THIS DISCUSSION FOR ME IS THAT TO HAVE GLOBAL SOLUTIONS TO GLOBAL PROBLEMS WE WILL ALSO NOT JUST NEED OUR EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS TO BE STRONG BUT OUR GLOBAL INSTITUTIONS TO BE STRONG
20170703-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170703-18:28:03_7 ORDER FOR A COUNTRY TO BE COMPETITIVE IT CANNOT BE CORRUPT IT DOES NEED TO ADDRESS CORRUPTION SO I BELIEVE WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING WITH THE VISIEFTE ON THE ONE HAND AND WITH PROPERLY ADDRESSING AND INCENTIVISING A FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION MOREOVER THAT IS INDEED THE RIGHT THING TO DO
20170315-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170315-19:17:51_9 THESE ARE THE MAIN REASONS WHY OUR GROUP IS UNABLE TO SUPPORT THE REPORT EVEN THOUGH WE ARE COMMITTED TO A STRONGER EUROPEAN COMMON DEFENSE AND SECURITY POLICY AND THERE ARE MANY VERY GOOD IDEAS IN THE REPORT IN GENERAL

20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_30 EXCEPTIONAL ADDITIONAL REVENUE FROM FINES STREAMING FROM THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE COMPETITION POLICY MEANS THAT THE ADDITIONAL PAYMENT REQUEST FOR TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WILL BE IN TOTAL AT NO COST FOR MEMBERSSAKE
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_2 FIRST THE CONTEXT OF THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS RENDERS ANY ENCOURAGEMENT OF GREATER CO OPERATION BETWEEN E B R D AND E I B MORE RELEVANT THAN EVER

20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_9 DOESN'T WORK AND I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT WE CAN TAKE AWAY THE LOST EXEMPTIONS FOR AIRPORTS AND HARBORS AND SO ON FOR USING THESE INEFFICIENT METHODS THAT CREATE PEOPLE FEELING BAD
20170315-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170315-17:37:31_7 THERE IS ONE THING THAT I BELIEVE WE CAN DO IMMEDIATELY DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUES AND TO MORROW WE CAN SHOW THE DETERMINATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT TO INSURE CLEAN AND SUSTAINABLE MINERAL SUPPLY CHAIN

20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_3 HOWEVER THE MOST OFFENSIVE POSITION THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN IS THE PROPOSAL THAT SPAIN WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO VETO ANY BREXEPDEAL OVER THE ISSUE OF GIBRALTAR

20180205-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180205-20:59:23_7 THE NEXT STEP WE SHOULD TAKE IS HARMONIZATION OF THE VIA T RULES WE ALSO NEED TO UNIFY COPYRIGHT PROTECTION RULES AND OPEN UP THE SERVICES MARKET IN THE AUDIOVISUAL SECTOR
20171212-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171212-19:53:15_1 WE SHOULD NOT BE HYPOCRITICAL CLINGING FORMARLY TO THE LETTER OF THE TREATY AND TAKING IT AS A  AS AN EXCUSE TO LOOK ASIDE FROM THE REAL SITUATION

20150611-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150611-10:25:51_0 FOR THE MOMENT THE CULTURAL CLEANSING UNDERTAKEN BY DAISH AT OTHER PRECIOUS SIGHTS THEY'VE SEIZED HAS NOT TAKEN PLACE AT PALMERA ONE OF THE GREATEST OF ALL CULTURAL TREASURES OF THE MIDDLE EAST
20090310-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090310-09:24:48_9 THAT IS WHY I PROPOSED TO THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE ACCEPTED AN AMENDMENT THAT SAID THESE TIRES THAT DID NOT MEET THESE STANDARDS AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE SHOULD BE SOLD OFF AFTER TWELVE MONTHS
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_12 THE RE LAUNCH OF THE ECONOMY AND THE SINGLE MARKET WILL NEED THE CONTINUED IMPETUS AND IMPUT AND HOPEFULLY THE LEADERSHIP OF THE COMMISSION AND THE COMMITTED OWNERSHIP BY THE MEMBER STATES
20151215-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151215-22:31:33_2 IN THE SPEECH YOU SAID THAT AFTER A YEAR OF WORK IN ANOTHER COUNTRY THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE FRONTIER WORKER HAD WORKED SHOULD BE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PAYMENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
20110509-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20110509-21:33:24_9 OF COURSE THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT DEMAND THAT THE COMMISSION IS FULLY TRANSPARENT IN ALL NEGOTIATIONS AND THAT WE ARE PROVIDED WITH TIMELY SECTORAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-16:34:02_5 DAPHNA GALICIA WAS KNOWN INTERNATIONALLY WAS KNOWN GLOBALLY FOR HER FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION SHE REPORTED ON THE CORRUPTION
20130418-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20130418-11:45:08_0 THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL THE SHADOW APOTAS BECAUSE THIS NEGOTIATION PROCEDURE HAS NOT BEEN THA TRADITIONAL I WANT THIS YOU WANT THAT LET US MEET IN THE MID
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_7 OUR COMMITTEES DRAWN ATTENTION TO TWO SPECIFIC CONCERNS WHAT WE REGARD AS BEING THE UNEQUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRODUCERS AND RETAILERS PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO FOOD RETAILING
20171025-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171025-09:28:48_7 WE ARE NOT FIXING THE SYSTEM WHICH ISN'T WORKING BECAUSE SOME OF THE MEMBER STATE AUSORIETIES ARE NOT THOROUGHLY WORKING WITH THE SYSTEM FEEDING INTO E INFORMATION TO THE SYSTEM SOME OF THE OUTER BORDERS
20141124-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141124-19:43:56_4 HOWEVER THIS IMPLIES A REVISION OF THE MOTI ANNUAL FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK ON THE BASIS OF A COMMISSIONED PROPOSAL WITH THE COUNCIL'S AGREEMENT AND PARLIAMENT'S CONSENT
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_17 BUT ALSO IN THE LAST COUNSE IT WAS CLEAR THAT MANY MEMBER STATES HAVE STATED THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO TAKE AGAIN ADDITIONAL MEASURES THEY HAVE TO BE LINKED TO THE REDUCTION OF THE MILK PRODUCTION
20101110-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20101110-20:00:29_7 MORE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP ON THE SINGLE MARKET FROM THE PRECIDENTS OF THE COMMISSION AND COUNCIL WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS ACHIEVING A VIABLE SINGLE MARKET TO SERVE AS A CATALIST FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY
20090422-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090422-10:01:07_3 I'M STRUCK AT THE FACT THAT THE LIBERALS AND CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT ROPES ARE CONCERNED AT OVER PRESCRIPTION OR THAT PROTECTIONISM MAY BE INTRODUCED THROUGH THE BACK DOOR
20170405-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20170405-22:06:17_1 WHO IS STILL OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THIS VERY COMPLICATED PROBLEM AND ON BEHALF OF THE E BI B GROUP I CAN SAY THAT I FULLY SUPPORT HIS STANDER
20180531-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180531-15:00:20_3 THROUGH ITS EXTERNAL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND THE EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT AIR FUND THE E PROVIDES BILLIONS OF EUROSEAN ASSISTANCE TO THIRD COUNTRIES THROUGH INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AMONG OTHER CHANNELS
20151027-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20151027-16:20:10_6 THE SECOND POINT IS WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE NOMENCLATURE OF THE AMIT BUDGET LINES BECAUSE PUTTING INTEGRATION AND RETURN TOGETHER ON ONE BUDGET LINE JUST AVOIDING BEING CLEAR ON WHAT THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_1 MEAN WE OWE TO THE TO THE LABOR OF OUR WORKING POPULATION IN EUROPE BUT THE BASIS OF OUR WELL BEING IS INNOVATION
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_31 YOU CAN'T SURVIVE BEING AT SEA SO YOU HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH THE OTHER COUNTRY ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH COUNTRIES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EXTERNAL BORDERS SO AGREEMENT WITH TURKEY WAS NECESSARY IN ANY CASE
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_23 BUT ONE THING HAS TO BE CLEAR THAT THEIR ONLY SOLUTION IS TO ER APPLY FOR ASYLUM IN GREECE GET INTO THAT SYSTEM AND OFFER THEMSELVES UP FOR RELOCATION
20170213-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170213-20:41:06_10 YOU NEED TO SHOW COMPANIES THAT THEY CANNOT BE REWARDED FOR LOSING FIVE BECAUSE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS ROGAL ACTITUDE AND BEHAVIOR HAS CAUSED MORE DAMAGES TO COMPLAIN AN COMPANIES
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_12 I ALSO CALL FOR GREATER INTERNAL EXTERNAL COHERENCE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS AND TO FURTHER ENHANCE AND DEEPEN CO OPERATION AND COORDINATION AMONG ALL RELEVANT ACTIONS
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:43:11_18 I BELIEVE SOCIAL AFFAIRS HAS TO STAY AT THA NATIONAL LEVEL BUT WHEN SOCIAL AFFAIRS HAVE A CROSS BORDER IMPACT THEN ALSO EUROPE NEEDS TO GET A INVOLVED AND
20170316-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170316-09:26:23_8 WITHOUT THE POWER TO MEASURE ANALYZE UTILIZE FISHING DATA THE YUKE WILL STILL BE UNABLE TO FORMULATE ITS OWN FISHERIS POLICIES AND WILL REMAIN UNDER THE HEDGEMANY OF THE C F P
20090504-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090504-17:16:47_2 WE ALL KNOW THAT IRELAND HAS REJECTED THE LISBON TREATY AND SO IT IS OF SOME WONDERMENT TO ME THAT THIS HOUSE PERSISTS IN DEBATING THAT MATTER
20121022-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20121022-18:49:22_12 ALL EGO CITIZENS MUST BE INFORMED AND ENJOY WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION ALL RIGHTS GRANTED TO THEM BY UNION LAW AND THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IE
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_17 IN ORDER TO ADDRESS CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY PARLIAMENTS THE EXTENSION OF THE AUTONOMOUS TRADE PREFERENCES IS SUBJECTED TO A QUAIN'S RESPECT FOR THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THE ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT
20170517-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20170517-21:49:41_6 SO IN THIS REGARD WE REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THA FUTURE MUCH MORE PRO ACTIVE AND CO OPERATIVE ROLE FROM COMMISSION SIDE OTHERWISE IT WILL BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO CO OPERATE
20180704-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180704-15:50:40_7 IT WOULD ALSO BE GOOD TO UNDERSTAND HOW REVENUES FROM INCOME TAX HAVE BEEN LOWER IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THAN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN EVEN THOUGH THE ECONOMY OF THE COUNTRY IS GROWING
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-15:50:40_7 IT WOULD ALSO BE GOOD TO UNDERSTAND HOW REVENUES FROM INCOME TAX HAVE BEEN LOWER IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THAN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN EVEN THOUGH THE ECONOMY OF THE COUNTRY IS GROWING
20180206-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180206-18:17:12_2 THEREFORE I SINCERELY WELCOME THE COMMISSIONER'S STRATEGY AND THE ACTION PLAN AS DOCUMENTS WHICH WILL OFFICIALLY AND PERMANENTLY PUT A WESTERN BALCAN ENLARGEMENT BACK ON THE EUROPEAN AGENDA
20140113-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20140113-18:10:36_1 THE SHOWED THAT WITH A MORE AMBITIOUS PROPOSAL THE FUEL SAVING COST WOULD BE MUCH BIGGER THAN THE COST OF A NEW VEHICLE THE RELATIVE COST OF THE INCREASE OF THE NEW VEHICLES
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_8 SAYING A FIRM NOTE TO F G M FOR ME ALSO MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE PROTECTIVE LAWS AND WE HAVE TO PROVIDE STRONG SUPPORT TO THE GROSSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS THAT WORK ON THIS
20150527-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150527-20:59:58_2 WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO INVEST OUR EFFORTS TO GUARANTEE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EXISTING TOOLS AND THE FULL USE OF EENI DEDICATED TO THE FIGHT AGAINST SYBERES THREATS
20201008-0900-PLENARY-en_20201008-11:26:32_4 IT IS SOMETHING ROTTEN AND ROTTEN IN A WORLD WHEN PEOPLE CAN BE JAILED AND IN WORSE CASES BE DEPRIVED THEIR LIVES JUST BECAUSE THEY DREAM OF A BETTER SOCIETY A BETTER WORLD
20090422-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20090422-23:01:25_4 SO OFTEN AS ELECTED MEMBERS WE JOURNEY ROUND OUR CONSTITUENCIES AND FIND OURSELVES IN TRAFFIC JAMS AND SO OFTEN WE HAVE TO MAKE A PHONE COURSE TO FIND OUT WHAT THE SITUATION IS AHEAD
20141022-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20141022-17:30:24_11 IF WE IN THIS HOUSE ARE SILENCED WE APPROVE OF THE MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO PROTEST AND MAKE SURE THAT THE DEMONSTRATORS ACTUALLY ARE SEEN AND THAT WE DO NOT FORGET THEIR DEEDS
20150907-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20150907-18:47:26_12 FAILING TO DO SO MANY HAVE SEVERAL CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO FALL APART ALMOST SIXTY YEARS PASSED SINCE ITS FOUNDATION
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:32:20_10 THE DECISION ON THE ACCESSION TO SHENGEN MUST BE BASED ON TECHNICAL CRITARIA AND DELAY BASED ON POLITICAL REASONS IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_25 RESEARCHER IF YOU'RE INNOVATER IF YOU'RE SMART IF YOU'RE INNOVATIVE YOU GO TO THE COMMISSION AND YOU COULD SAY IN THE FRAMEWORK OF WHAT HAD BEEN DECIDED IN THE PROGRAMME DO WE GET FUNDED
20170202-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20170202-11:11:26_0 ADOPTION IS A WONDERFUL ALTERNATIVE FOR OTHERWISE UNWANTED CHILDREN OR A CHILD THAT'S LEFT IN AN UNSAFE ENVIRONMENT
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_8 AT TA TIME WHEN JUDALIZATION IS GROWING FAST THIS LACK OF ACCESS IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE TO DEVELOPMENT AS IT CONTINUES TO WIDEN GAPS AND INEQUALITIES IN THE WORLD
20180418-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20180418-13:33:54_1 ON THE ONE SIDE THERE IS MY COUNTRY HUNGARY A WITH THE VISHAGRADE COUNTRIES REPRESENTING  CLEARLY THE MAJORITY OF EUROPEAN CITIZENS
20170426-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170426-16:44:25_5 THE ANGIOTHING PRIME MINISTER IS NOT ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AS WE ALL KNOW IT IS IN ORDER TO LABEL ANGIOS THAT ARE FOREIGN FOUNDED AS FOREIGN BECAUSE THEY MIGHT CARRY FOREIGN INFLUENCE INTO HUNGARY AND FOREIGN INFLUENCES BAD
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_6 THE RESOLUTION OF THE FISHERIES COMMITTEE DISCUSSES THE COMMISSION SERBI FOR CONTROL OF TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN WHICH ANALYZES THE CONFORMITY OF LABELLING WITH THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS OF WHITE FISH IN RETAIL
20180118-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180118-10:27:06_2 NMIGRATION ILLICIT MIGRATION ROOTS IS THE ORIGIN OF MASSIVE AND GROSS HUMAN RIGHTS O VIOLATION AIMING MOSTLY ON WOMEN AND DEFENCELESS CHILDREN
20121119-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20121119-21:10:43_2 PAGET CONSOLIDATION NEEDS TO BE COMPLIMENTED BY A SOCIAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY THAT WILL ADDRESS THE SOCIAL EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION TARKETS OF THE E U TWENTY TWENTY STRATEGY
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_14 FIRST AND FOREMOST MEMBER STATES HAVE TO REINFORCE CONTROLS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY FRAUD AND THE MISSING LINKS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN FOR FISHERY AND AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS WHICH LEAD TO MISLABELLING OR FRAUD
20160704-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20160704-17:45:12_8 THE INCONVENIENT TRUTH FOR THOSE WHO SOUGHT T TO ARGUE THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF A BRITAN OUTSIDE EYU IS THAT AIR POLLUTION HAS AN UNFORTUNATE HABIT OF NOT RESPECTING BOARDERS
20141022-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20141022-17:30:24_5 WHEN STUDENTS PEACEFULLY PROTEST FOR THEIR DEMOCRATIC AND INDEED HUMAN RIGHTS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD THEY DESERVE TO BE BACKED UP BY US IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A GLOBAL POWER OF DEMOCRACY
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_5 AND THIS IS A PROCESS THAT IS GATHERING PACE IN TERMS OF MODERNIZATION BECAUSE THE COMMISSION IS CURRENTLY BRINGING FORWARD PROPOSALS IN A WHITE PAPER ON INTRODUCING PRIVATE DAMAGES
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-22:17:13_2 I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUOS CHALLENGES WE HAVE IS THAT WE HAVE TOO MANY PRIORITIES AND TOO LITTLE MONEY AND THE QUESTION IS SIR HOW WE USE THE MONEY IN THE IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-22:17:13_1 I THINK H DISCUSSIONS SHOW THAT WE MAY HAVE SOME DIFFERENT VIEWS BUT IN GENERAL WE ARE UNITED BY THE FACT THAT WE WANT TO HAVE A WORKABLE BUDGET A GOOD BUDGET FOR EUROPEAN CITIZENS
20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_2 SO WE CAN BE VERY PROUD AS THE EUR OPIN UNION AND ESPECIALLY OF THE PARLIAMENT THAT WE HAVE A TOOL TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY AND INTEGRITY OF OUR CITIZEN'S LIFE WITH THE JUDIPIAR IN PLACE
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_16 THERE IS TRADE ROUND THE WORLD AT A SPEED THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE UNTIL THIS CRISIS AND WE HAVE GOT TO DEAL WITH THAT BY CREATING A GLOBAL TRADING ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS FREE BUT ALSO FAIR
20170405-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20170405-22:06:17_3 THE INTERNAL SITUATION REMAINS EXTREMELY COMPLICATED BUT WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS OUR SHARED WORRY AND SHARED RESPONSIBILITY
20130205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20130205-09:52:51_3 IT WILL ALLOW US TO RESTORE FICH AND INCREASE THE INCOME OF FISHERMEN THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION BY INCREASING BOTH THE QUANTITY AND THE SIZE OF FISH COT
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_1 THE EUROPEAN UNION IS NOT ABOUT BRUSSELS IT IS NOT ABOUT STRASBURG NOR IS IT ABOUT THE INSTITUTIONS TO WHICH MANY OF US INVOLVED IN TODAY'S DEBATE BELONG

20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_3 AND SOME PEOPLE BORN IN A DIFFERENT TIME LIKE MYSELF MIGHT WANT TO GO BACK TO HOW IT WAS BEFORE BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE A SIMPLER TIME
20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_13 IN SOME CASES A CERTIFICATE OF LEGALITY WILL ONLY BE AS A STARTING POINT THE FIRST MEASURE INCLUDED IN THE DUE DILIGENCE PROCEDURE
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_16 THIS IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANT FOR EUROPE'S FINANCIAL INTEREST STRUCTURE BUT ALSO FOR THE REAL ECONOMY WITH CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES BENEFITING FROM IMPROVED FINANCIAL SERVICES
20180206-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180206-11:12:41_5 IT'S ABOUT THE LACK OF VISION TO FACE WITH THE EUROPEAN FASHION THE URO'S OWN NEEDS GLOBALIZATION AND MOST NOTABLY REFUGEE CRISIS
20150430-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150430-09:30:09_5 FIRST WE NEED THE BANK TO MAKE USE OF THE MEASURES CONTAINED WITHIN THE ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING DIRECTIVE AND PARTICULARLY TO ACCESS THE NEW REGISTERS OF BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF COMPANIES
20141126-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141126-21:49:15_6 TO GO ON WITH ANY KIND OF DITITAL SERVICES WE HAVE TO HAVE VERY STRONG COMMON SIMPLE UNDERSTANDABLEER DATA PROTECTION REGULATION

20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_14 THIS IS ONE AREA WHEREVE THERE HAS BEEN MUCH DISCUSSION AMONG THE MEMBER STATES BUT THE OVER ALL APPROACH IS THAT POLITORIINTATIONS WILL BE TAKEN BY THE COUNCIL

20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_25 A BETTER POINT OF DEPARTURE IS INVESTIGATING WHERE CURRENT LEGISLATION CAUSES UNCERTAINTIES OR BARRIERS AND IDENTIFYING WHERE ADDITIONAL ACTION IS NECESSARY

20180530-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20180530-16:50:04_9 IN HUNGARY I SUPPOSE THAT IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS WHEN THEY WERE STILL RUNNING NEWSPAPER ABS IN ORDER TO SELL THEIR PASSPORTS THE MONEY HAD TO BE TRANSFERRED INTO AN OFFSHORE ACCOUNT THAT APPARENTLY BELONGED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF
20180502-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20180502-20:31:09_1 THEY SEND THEIR CHILDREN TOA SPECIAL SO CALLED EUROPEAN SCHOOL WHICH IS COMPLETELY  ISOLATED FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
20171003-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20171003-18:00:00_7 AND TO SAY THAT WE ARE PASSING ON THE MESSAGE MISTER COMMISSIONER IS JUST NOT ENOUGH YOU DON'T PASS THE MESSAGE ABOUT HUMORITES YOU DEMAND HUMORITES TO BE RESPECTED
20130911-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20130911-18:45:35_2 THE TECHNOLOGICAL MILITARY AND ECONOMIC LOGIC OF A MORE INTEGRATED EU DEFENSE POLICY IS INESCAPABLE BUT THE PROBLEM IS EXCLUSIVELY POLITICAL
20170614-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170614-11:59:57_9 SO ITS CLEAR THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE GREAT PARTNERS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES EVEN IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECIDES TO STAY ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_7 THESE PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISRUPTIONS LIKE MOBILE PAYMENTS OPEN BANKING CROWD FUNDING CRYPTO CURRENCIES AND ROBE OF ADVICE
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_22 IF WE START OFF WITH CONFLICTING REGULATIONS AND DIRECTIVES THAT UNDERMINE EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF COMPLIMENTING EACH OTHER WE HAVE LOST THE BATTLE BEFORE IT STORPS

20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_8 IN THIS AREA WE THE U K CAN LEARN FROM OUR CONTINENTAL COUSINS BECAUSE THE FRENCH GIVE REPRESENTATION TO THEIR OVERSEAS TERRITORIES AND I PROPOSE THAT WE SHOULD TOO
20160705-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20160705-18:52:45_3 UNDER THE NEW REGULATION THE MANAGEMENT OF THE EXTERNAL BORDERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL BE THE SHARED RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MEMBER STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION
20160913-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20160913-13:47:41_3 UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT INSTRUMENTS ARE INSUFFICIENT AND DO NOT PROVIDE ESEMESE ESPECIALLY MICRO AND SMALL ENTERPRISES WITH THE NECESSARY MEANS TO FINANCE INVESTMENTS
20180116-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180116-20:56:23_15 THE WAY FORWARD IS TO CONSOLIDATE THESE CHAPTERS AND TO STRIVE FOR HA MORE EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS IMPORTANT PILLAR IN OUR VALUE BASED TRADE POLICY
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:40:33_3 DELAYS IN THE EXTENSION OF TRADE PREFERENCES SHOULD INDEED BE AVOIDED AND THIS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON ECONOMIC OPERATOR'S DECISION TO IMPORT GOODS FROM UKRANE

20090219-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090219-09:28:09_14 NO DOUBT THE GESTURES TOWARDS EUROPEAN UNION WILL CONTINUE BUT DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENTS HAVE A PRIMARY INTEREST IN LOOKING AFTER THE POPULATIONS THAT ELECTED THEM

20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-21:20:51_9 THE AIM IS TO PERFORM BETTER THAN TO SHOW IT SIMPLE RULES AS THE COMMISSIONER SAID TO COMBINE FRINDS AND THIS IS I THINK THE NEED FROM BEYOND

20180205-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180205-21:11:01_2 IT DISTORTS THE COMPETITION SOMETIMES IT HELPS TO FINANCE ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES AND IF LOSSES ARE TOO HIGH IT CAN PUSH UP THE TEXT RATES IN OTHER CATEGORIES
20090324-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20090324-22:20:58_7 I THEREFORE AGREE WITH A REPORTEUR'S APPROACH URGING THE COMMISSION TO COME UP WITH A SEPARATE PIECE OF LEGISLATION ON CLOTE
20170614-0900-PLENARY-25-en_20170614-22:35:45_4 A PARTY REPRESENTED BY ONE M P STILL NEEDS TO BE REPRESENTED IN AT LEAST A QUARTER OF THE MEMBER STAGE IN ORDER TO BE RESISTED

20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_22 IT COULD HELP IN THE CREATION OF AN EXTERNAL STRUCTURE WICH WHICH SCRUTINIZES THE CERTIFIATION OF VOLUNTARY CLAIMS INCLUDENG ON THE LABEL OF FISHERY AND AGRICULTUREAL PRODUCTS
20151202-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20151202-22:34:44_10 I THINK WE SHOULD DO MORE TO PROTECT LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS THE ENDANGERED SPECIES IN THE PARK SUCH AS THE MOUNTAIN GORILLAS AND OCAPIS
20171115-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171115-10:11:28_12 THE PROBLEM IN POLAND IS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO CHANGE THE STATE AND TO MODEL IT SO THAT GENERATIONS TO COME WILL HAVE NO CHANCE TO CHANGE IT BACK FOR THE BETTER
20201005-0900-PLENARY-en_20201005-17:55:49_3 HOWEVER I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE CURRENT DEVELOPMENT AT THE SAME TIME WE SEE ATTACKS ON INDEPENDENT MEDIA ON EGIBITITUY PEOPLE WE SEE ATTACKS ON WOMEN WE SEE ATTACKS ON MIGRANTWE
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_18 WE MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN TO EXPLAIN THAT THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE TO THE UNION NOT IN THE PAST NOT NOW AND NOT IN THE FUTURE
20121023-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20121023-22:06:22_9 NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO SAY LET'S WAIT A FEW MORE MONTHS OR WE NEED MORE CONCESSIONS NOW IS THE TIME TO LAUNCH NEGOTIATIONS WITH JAPAN
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-11:24:15_74 I DID NOT MENTION IT IN MY SPEECH BUTH SAME PAY FOR THE SAME WORK IN THE CIRCUMSTACE AND IN THE SAME TYPE OF CIRCUMSTANCES IS AT THE CORE OF THE BELIEF OF THE DESTH GOVERNMENT AND WE WILL PUSH FOR DAT AND
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-21:57:09_20 AND CLARIFY THE EFFECTS OF THE LATE START FOR THE NEXT YEAR'S EMPLESTORY WILL LEAD TO A PERFORMANCE WITH PAYMENTS IN THE YEARS AND UNTIL
20160913-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20160913-13:58:14_3 WE HAVE TO ENSURE WELL PLANNED INVESTMENTS SO THAT THE PROPOSED BILLIONS REALLY BENEFIT THE CITIZENS IN PROJECTS WHICH IMPROVE EDUCATION HEALTH CARE AND INFERSTRUCTURE
20150210-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150210-12:38:08_3 AND IN THIS PERSPECTIVE ONE MIGHT BE MINOR BUT IMPORTANT THING COULD BE N EMPLOYEE FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION E F P
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_4 THE REASON WHY OF THE WELL BEING OF THAT CONTINENT RELATES STARTING IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ON ITS ABILITY TO INNOVATE
20090915-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090915-19:04:10_16 FURTHERMORE WE HAVE TO STRENGTHEN SUPPORT TO THE POOREST AND MOST VULNERABLE COUNTRIES TO ADAPT TO THE INCREASING ADVERSE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGES
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_12 IT IS COMPREHENSIVE BUT IT WILL NOT SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS BUT OUR WORKERS SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES AND PEOPLE ARE FACING
20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_14 IF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS WORTH ANYTHING AT ALL THOSE WHO PLAY HARD BALL WITH US SHOULD AND I HOPE WILL FIND THAT WE CAN PLAY HARD BALL WITH THEM
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_13 WE HAVE NOT ACHIEVED ANY MEANFUL TRANSPARENCY OVER HOW ALLEGORYTUMS PUSH CONTENT TO USERS ON A MASSIVE SCALE
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_10 LET US BE HONEST WITH EACH OTHER COLLEGUES DE YU HAS DONE MORE TO REGULATE THE ONLINE WORLD THAN ANY OTHER CONTINENT
20170202-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20170202-11:11:26_1 BUT WHAT CONCERNS ME ABOUT THIS REPORT IS THAT IT'S ANOTHER PARAGRAB BY BRUSSELS OVER THE JURISDICTION OF FAMILY LAW
20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_7 I PROPOSED THAT THE COUNCIL WOULD HAVE PERMANENT MEMBERS THE EUROPEAN UNION U S A JAPAN AND THE BRIX COUNTRIES AND ROTATING ONES
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_35 I BELIEVE THAT WHATEVER THE DIFFERENT VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS PARLIAMENT THERE IS A WILL ACROSS THE PEOPLES OF THIS WORLD TO DO THAT AND WE EUROPE CAN PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN IT 
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_27 FINALLY I WOULD LIKE OF COURSE PERSONALLY TO THANK ALL THE SHADOW RAPORTERS AND ALL MY COLLEAGUES ON THE LIBE D S A REPORT FOR THEIR EXCELLENT CO OPERATION
20130418-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20130418-11:45:08_9 POINT TWO SO PLEASE SUPPORT THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AMENDMENT THIRTY ONE AND THIRTY TWO SO WE CAN NEGOTIATE WITH A COUNCIL WHO STANDS READY TO NEGOTIATE WITH US
20180205-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180205-21:11:01_6 I AM GLAD THAT THE IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROPOSAL IS THE SIMPLIFICATION OF THE TAX COMPLIANCE ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_5 LUCKILY THERE'S ONE TECHNOLOGY WE ALL AGREE ON THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DE CARBONIZE AT LEAST OUR HEAVY INDUSTRIES IN TRANSPORT HYDROGEN
20110215-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20110215-09:31:28_2 THE FACT THAT THAT IS COLDER HERE NOW IS ALSO QUITE PREDICTABLE BECAUSE IF THE GULF STREAM IS PRESSED DOWN BY MELT WATER FROM THE ARCTIC THIS IS AN EXPLAINABLE EFFECT
20170613-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20170613-22:37:50_5 ONE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT IS THAT REDUCING CORRUPTION AND ORGANIZED CRIME AND MAKING JUDICIALY MORE EFFICIENT HAS BEEN ASSESSED AS GOOD BY THE COMMISSION
20180207-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180207-09:33:00_4 IF WE ARE NOT A FEDERATION WHY SHOULD WE HAVE A JOINT CONSTITUENCY THAT NOT EVEN THE FEDERATIONS HAVE
20160704-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20160704-17:48:37_3 BUT NOW A STRICT RULE ADA REAL VISION TO THE FUTURE IS SOMETHING WHAT WE HAVE TO TELL THE PEOPLE BECAUSE THIS IS THE TRUTH THAT OUR ENVIRONMENT IS IN HEAVY DANGER
20180530-0900-PLENARY-29-en_20180530-22:44:10_4 THIS IS WHY WE PROPOSE ANHANSING DECORDINATION AT ALL LEVELS THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EUROPEAN UNION YOUTH COORDINATOR IN THE DESIGN OF NATIONAL ACTION PLANS
20170315-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170315-22:06:27_1 AHEAD OF THE MEETING AS WE KNOW SOME OF YOU LEADERS VOICE CONCERNS ABOUT EXTERNAL DE STABILIZING INFLUENCES ON THE REGION AND THESE HAVE BEEN MENTIONED AGAIN TO NIGHT
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_14 THIS DIRECTIVE IS ESSENTIALLY A FORERUNNER IN THE PLANT EUROPEAN ACCESSIBILITY ACT WHICH I KNOW IS ALSO BEING EAGERLY AWAITED BY OUR CITIZENS
20121023-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20121023-22:06:22_1 WE CANNOT ACCEPT THAT OUR TWO WAY TRADE WITH THE WORLD'S TURT LARGEST NATIONAL ECONOMY IS ONLY A QUARTER OF OUR TRADE WITH THE U S A OR CHINA
20140312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20140312-21:46:07_19 I FER IS FOUNDATION AND I SEE BE WILL TAKE MEASURES FOR INTEREST DISCLOSURE IN ORDER TO AVOID CONFLICT OF INTEREST
20180228-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180228-18:17:01_2 MORE THAN EVER IT IS CRUCIAL THAT THE E SUPPORTS THE YON HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL FINANCIALLY AND POLITICALLY TO INSURE THAT IT CAN CONTINUE TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY
20141124-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141124-19:43:56_12 USAND FOURTEEN IN THIS CONNECTION DOES THE COMMISSION ENVISAGE TAKING ANY MEASURES TO FACILITATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OPERATIONAL PROGRAMME
20180205-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180205-21:11:01_11 IN MY VIEW A MONEY GAIND SHOULD BE INVESTED MAINLY IN THE REDUCTION OF THE PUBLIC DEBT AND THE REDUCTION OF THE MOST DEVASTATING TAXES FOR THE ECONOMIC GROWTHS
20150429-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20150429-22:59:14_2 HOWEVER THE QUALITY OF THE COUNCIL DECISION DEPENDS TO A LARGE EXTENT ON THE QUALITY OF THE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED TO IT
20140312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20140312-16:57:27_10 BLAMING BRUSSELS IS SADLY TO SAY A RATHER COMMON WAY FOR NATIONAL POLITICIANS AND SOME OTHERS TO ESCAPE THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITIES
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_22 WE MUST USE AS A BASIC PLATFORM THE ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLES RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND DIGNITY FREEDOM EQUALITY AND RULE OF LAW
20131007-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131007-20:14:10_6 STEREOTYPES AGAINST WOMEN PREVENTING THEM TO FULLY ENJOY EQUAL TREATMENT IN EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN MANY COUNTRIES
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_26 AND DOING THIS PURPOSELLY REQUIRES A HOLISTIC APPROACH AS TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR DIGITIZING SOCIETY CALL FOR BREAKING SILENCE
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_6 LESS THAN ONE THIRD OF EUROPE'S PUBLIC SECTOR AND GOVERNMENT WEBSIDES AND EVEN LESS THAN TEN PER CENT OF EUROPE'S WEBSIDES IN GENERAL ARE FULLY ACCESSIBLE
20170704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170704-17:12:49_4 SHOULD DO THE PLANNING FOR FOR STRUCTURE AND IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THOSE WHO DO THIS PLANNING WOULD BE ANSWERABLE TO SOMEBODY POSSIBLY A PARLIAMENTARY BODY AT THE SAME TIME
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_4 IF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE SOLUTION  WE HAD A POWER CUT RIGHT ACROSS THE BANKING SYSTEM RIGHT ACROSS THE WORLD
20180531-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180531-15:00:20_1 THESE INCLUDE THE SEXUAL EXPLORTATIONS OF SYRIAN REFUGEES BY THOSE DELIVERING AID ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND OTHER WELL KNOWN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_2 THE LEGISLATORE DEFINED BOTH MANETARY INFORMATION AND VOLET VOLUNTARY INFORMATION FOR  CONSUMERS MAKING INFORMATION A CRUCIAL POINT OF THE LEGISLATION
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_13 WHAT MEMBER STATES MUST DO IS TO STOP BLAMING EUROPE FOR WHAT EUROPE CANNOT DO BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE TOOLS
20090310-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090310-13:44:27_4 WE HAVE TO INSURE THAT OUR LEGISLATION IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE PROBLEMS WE'RE DEALING WITH AND PARTICULARLYI THE I P P C THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TO DAY
20090219-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090219-09:28:09_13 NEVER MIND THAT PRUDENT GOVERNMENT FINANCIES ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE SURVIVAL OF THE UREAU THERE IS NOTHING ELSE THAT THESE COUNTRIES CAN DO ABOUT THEIR BUDGETS
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_5 DIJUDA TACHNOLOGIS HAVTHER HUGE POTENTIALS AND TERMS OF REDUCING POVERTY INCREASING THE COMPETITIVENESS OF ECONOMY AND CREATING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-16:35:19_5 YOU LOOK TO THE GREAT CHALLENGES OF EUROPE ITS MIGRATION AND SECURITY ITS SOLIDARITY OR THE LACK OF SOLIDARITY AND THE RUINING INEQUALITIES YOUMA
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_16 ADDITION WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A HARMONIZED EUROPEAN APPROACH MAKING THESE WEBSITES ACCESSIBLE ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A HIGHLY PROFITABLE BUSINESS
20180530-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20180530-16:50:04_12 THERE IS AN THATE IS CITIZENSHIP BY IDENTIFICATION INTEGRATION MERIT BELIEF IN WHAT WE STAND FOR AS NATIONS AND AS EUROPEAN UNION
20170703-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170703-17:34:14_5 AND THIS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE SHORTTERM BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND FISCAL  VULNERABILITIES OF THE MODORVAN ECONOMY THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE THEREFORE AMOUNTS TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION EUR
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-15:10:37_4 SECOND WE WANT THE MALTISE AUTHORITIES TO INVESTIGATE AND TO PROSECUTE MANY LAGERING NO MATTER THE NAMES OR THE ORGANIZATIONS IMPLICATED
20120201-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20120201-20:10:03_1 FOR THE IU THE IMMEDIATE CHALLENGE IS TO HELP ENSURE A FAIR AND INCLUSIVE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND BE PREPARED FOR A RANGE OF SCENARIOS
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_9 I HAVE BEEN TOILING THIS FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND WITH THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES THAT BREAKFAST HAS GIVEN US I BELIEVE IT IS AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME
20171004-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20171004-16:31:37_8 SAJUST LOOKING AT THE DATA IU WOULD OBSERVE THAT IN H UROZONE FROM TWO THOUSAND AND NINE EVERY YEAR THERE WAS DECLINE OF DEFICIT TO GIDIPI
20150519-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150519-10:48:07_4 WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF SKILLED LABOR IN THIS AREA AND THE SAME TIME THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS AND WILL NEED RETRAINING
20090324-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20090324-22:20:58_4 YET THE DEVECT DEVELOPMENT OF ANIMAL CLOTHING AS A METHOD OF FOOD PRODUCTION IS BEING PURSUED WITHOUT PUBLIC AWARENESS
20170405-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20170405-22:06:17_7 THE MAJOR PROBLEM REMAINS NATIONAL RECONCILIATION WHICH MEANS SERIOUS EFFORTS TO DEVELOP INCLUSIVENESS AND MUTUAL TRUST
20170313-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170313-18:46:20_5 THE E US CAP ON BANKERS BONUSES WAS CHALLENGED BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT BUT LARGELY SUPPORTED BY THE BRITISH PEOPLE JUST AS THEY SUPPORT ACTION TO MAKE CO PAY MORE ACCOUNTABLE

20180614-0900-PLENARY-en_20180614-12:20:00_11 CURRENTLY WE DO NOT HAVE A COMMON E MINIMUM WEIGHTS LEVEL IN TRANSPORT AND THE POSTING OF DRIVER'S DIRECTIVE IS NOT THE RIGHT TULE TO DO THAT
20180614-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20180614-12:20:00_10 CURRENTLY WE DO NOT HAVE A COMMON E MINIMUM WEIGHT LEVEL IN TRANSPORT AND THE POSTING OF DRIVER'S DIRECTIVE IS NOT THE RIGHT TOOL TO DO THAT
20090915-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090915-19:04:10_18 THERE IS A DAUNTING TASK AHEAD OF US WITH HE INTENSE NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE COMING MONTHS BUT FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION
20150527-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150527-20:59:58_8 WITH THIS DIRECTIVE THE EYU IS GOING INTO UNCHARTED TERRITORY IN ATTEMPTING TO MAKE OUR NEW DIGITAL LIVES MORE SAFE AND SECURE
20171003-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20171003-20:01:37_3 IF YO LOOK AT THE CURRENT SITUATION FOR CUSTOMERS NO REAL SAFEGUARDS EXIST AGAINST FLIGHT CANCULATIONS OR DELAYS
20170703-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170703-17:34:14_15 THESE ARE REFORMS THAT WILL DISCIPLINE AND CONSTRAIN THE EXERCISE OF POWER BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ANY OTHER ECONOMICOR POLITICAL ACTOR FOR GENERATIONS TO COME
20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_8 WE NEED TO GET MORE RULES IN PLACE ESPECIALLY ALSO FOR CONSUMER CONTROL TO GET CONNECTIVITY ACROSS THE PLATFORMS IN ORDER TO HAVE A CHOICE
20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_11 FIRSTLY I WOULD LIKE TO REFER TO THE DUE DILIGENCE APPROACH WHICH IS MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAN JUST A CERTIFICATE OF LEGALITY
20171026-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171026-09:32:35_5 THE REPORTS REFERENCES TO INSURING THE E U INSTITUTIONS THEMSELVES COMPLY WITH E U LAW COULD ALMOST BE OBLIGATORY
20120314-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20120314-15:57:49_2 LET ME SAY THAT SUCH A POLICY SHIFT WOULD BE A STRATEGIC BLUNDER THE E SHOULD CONTINUE TO DO WHAT IT IS DOING ONLY DO IT BETTER
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:58:09_8 QUESTION IS BASICALLY WHAT IS THE COMMISSION DOING TO PREVENT EXECUTION OF THESE INNOCENT PEOPLES WHO ONLY DREAM OOCRACY AND FREEDOM
20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_6 THE BUSINESS MODEL OF JUST EARNING MONEY BY ENDEAVORING THE DATA OF INDIVIDUALS HAS TO CHANGE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT ONLY THE BUSINESS MODEL OF
20130522-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20130522-16:27:10_4 TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND REFUGEES CAME TO EUROPE LAST YEAR ONE THIRD TO GERMANY ONE THIRD TO MY OWN COUNTRY AND THE REST TO THE EUROPEAN UNION
20121119-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20121119-19:43:02_3 THAT IS WHY I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT MEASURES THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN ARE RAISING YUS AWARENESS REGARDING INTERNETE TRANSACTIONAND SECURITY
20170404-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170404-10:00:04_2 IN THE PAST YEARS ALL OUR ATTENTION WAS FOCUSED TOWARDS THE LOWERING OF C OR TWO EMISSIONS AND PARTICLE MATTER WITHOUT DEVOTING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO KNOX
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_17 HOWEVER I WOULD STRESS TE THAT THE COMMISSION HAS NEITHER THE CAPACITY NOR THE DESIRE TO LEAVE THE DELIVERY OF THE ACTION PLAN ITSELF
20150706-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150706-22:31:39_0 TANKE A CHAIR A THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS RECENTLY PROVIDED HELP TO THE HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO MANAGE THE FLOWS OF MIGRANTS ENTERING THE COUNTRY

20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-10:48:45_5 THE SECOND IS ALSO WHY DOESN'T IT INCLUDE ALL THE COUNTRIES WHO HAVE THIS KIND OF SYSTEM IN PLACE  REFERRING TO THE INFRINGEMENT PROCESS OF COURSE
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_18 I BELIEVE THAT OUR COMMON GOAL IS TO HELP UKRANE BUT IT IS TRUE THAT WE NEED TO CLOSELY FOLLOWOUT THE SITUATION
20180205-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180205-19:21:11_9 LEAVING MILLIONS OF FRAUDULENT CARS ON OUR ROADS MORE THAN TWO YEARS AFTER THE DISLIGATE SCANDAL AND OUR COMMITTEE WORK IN THIS PARLIAMENT

20090219-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090219-09:28:09_7 PROBABLY AN EVEN MORE SERIOUS CONCERN IS THE HUGE EXPOSURE OF SEVERAL EUROPE'S UROPE'SONE COUNTRIES TOH DEFAULTING DEBTS OF EASTERN EUROPE
20170914-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20170914-10:42:57_3 IN THE RESOLUTION WE ALSO ADDRESS THE CASE OF THE LEADING CIVIL SOCIETY ACTIVIST SOME PATSOM PHONE WHO DISAPPEARED IN DECEMBER

20130418-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20130418-11:45:08_2 THIS REPORT WILL THEN HAVE A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT WILL MAKE IT PROFITABLE FOR SHIPOWNERS TO SCRAP THEIR SHIPS LEGALLY
20171129-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171129-21:08:54_7 YES TWO DAYS AGO SOMETHING HAPPENED ONE PORT AND THE SONA AIRPORT WERE REOPENED BUT IT'S FAR FROM BEING ENOUGH
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_8 THE SWEDISH PRESIDENCY HAS LED POSITIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS IN COUNCIL WHICH ARE TO LEAD TO CONCLUSIONS ALREADY IN OCTOBER

20110705-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20110705-11:13:29_7 USUALLY OUR GROUP IS PROPONENT OF COMMUNITY APPROACH BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ONE SIZE WITS WOL POLICY

20090915-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090915-19:04:10_4 HOWEVER AMONG MOST PARTIVES THERE IS A SENSE OF EREGENCY AND THE WILLINGNESS TO FOCUS ON AREAS OF CONVERGENCE
20090504-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20090504-22:11:56_6 I WOULD THEREFORE LIKE TO STRESS AGAIN THE IMPORTANCE OF REACHING FAIR TRADING AGREEMENT ON AN ISSUE WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE EUROPEAN UNION CITIZENS
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-21:57:09_9 THE EX ANTI CONDITIONALITIES WE FORMULATED LEAD TO MORE INTEGRATED POLICY AND A BETTER STRACTED AND TARGETED RESULTS

20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_10 OF COURSE SUCH ATRADEAL IS NOT A CURE A MEDICINE FOR EACH AND EVERY DISEASE
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_7 THE FUTURE WILL BE MORE DIGITAL NOT LESS AND IT BRINGS INCREDIBLE PROGRESS THAT WE AS POLICY MAKERS SHOULD EMBRACE

20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_8 THAT IS WHAT I THANK THE COMMISSION TO HAVE PRESENTED FIVE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS EVEN KNOWING THAT NONE OF THEM WILL BE FULLY ACCEPTED
20150519-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20150519-09:36:10_5 NOT ACTUALLY RESTRICT THE ACCESS TO THE EO MARKET AFOR THEM WHICH COULD BE A CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH EXTENSIVE REGULATIONS
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_21 HERE WE EXPECT TO SEE A WAVE OF COGNITION MEETINGS TO KICK START THE VARIOUS PRIORITY AREAS AND INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS INCLUDED IN THE ACTION PLAN
20180529-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180529-16:29:17_5 WEARLY ELECTIONS WOULD BE A SENSIBLE SHORT TERM COMPROMISE IN SUCH A DRAMATIC STAND OF OFFERING BOTH SIDES A DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION

20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_11 ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS THE COMMISSION IS NOW LOOKING AT THE EFFECT OF THE BAYLOUTS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE GREAT FINANCIAL TURMOIL

20151028-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20151028-17:37:47_1  THINGS ARE NOT IN LINE WITH THOSE HIGH STANDARDS IN SOME OR MANY OF OUR MEMBER STATES WEVEN DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
20091124-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20091124-09:52:50_4 THE MORAL MORAL LEADERSHIP OF EUROPE IS IMPORTANT BUT ALSO AN EXAMPLE BY SHOWING THAT GIVIIN BUSINESS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR COMPETITIVENESS
20171026-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171026-10:54:34_3 YOU MENTION THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SECONDARY LIABILITY REGIME BASED UPON THE SYSTEMS ALREADY ADOPTED BY SEVERAL MEMBERS OF STATE
20121212-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20121212-10:50:53_3 BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU MISTER GEAGLE WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN IF COUNTRIES LIKE SWEDEN DENMARK POLAND WILL BE OUTSIDE THE BANKING UNION WHAT
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_8 IF WE WANT TO PAVE THE WAY FOR CLEAN HYDROGEN WE INITIALLY WILL BEED TO INVEST IN TRANSITIONAL TECHNOLOGIES AND THESE MIGHT NOT BE PERFECT BUT THEY ARE GOOD

20090204-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20090204-17:04:59_3 BUT IN REALITY EACH MANUFACTURE IS GOING TO LOOK AFTER ITSELF AS BEST IT CAN AND EACH COUNTRY WILL LOOK AFTER ITS MANUFACTURERS AS BEST IT CAN
20151202-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20151202-22:34:44_11 I RECALL THAT OIL EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH UNESCO WORLD HEREDITARY STATES
20170315-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170315-19:17:51_2 HAS IT BEEN ABOUT UNLEASHING THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE LISBON TREATY A IN THE FIELD OF SECURITY AND DEFENSE WE WOULD BE IN FULL SUPPORT

20171026-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171026-09:32:35_4 I ALSO NOTE WITH CONCERN THAT THE EMPHASIS OF THIS REPORT IS ON BRINGING SOVEREIGN NATIONS STATES BACK INTO LINE
20150429-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20150429-22:59:14_5 TO FIND ONE FLEXIBILITY NEEDS TO BE SHOWN BY EVERY ONE AND I WILL REPEAT IT BY EVERY ONE

20180116-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180116-20:56:23_11 THE EXPERIENCE GATHERED SO FAR AT A GLOBAL LEVEL SHOWS THAT TRADE RELATED SANCTIONS FALL SHORT OF DELIVERING THE DESIRED RESULTS
20180704-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20180704-20:25:31_14 THE TOURISTS HAVE HAD TWO YEARS TO COME UP WITH A POSITION ON BREXET AND SHOW US A BLUEPRINT OF WHAT AN INDEPENDENT BRITOIN WOULD LOOK LIKE
20180312-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180312-22:30:11_11 I HAVE IN MIND FOR EXAMPLE THE YOK OF AN ANT OF MAYORS WHICH HAS BEEN CONTRIBUTEG TO OUR CLIMATE AND THE ENERGY OBJECTIVE SINCE

20121023-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20121023-22:06:22_3 THE COMMISSION HAS ESTIMATED THAT NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF THESE GAINS OF THE EUSTRADE POLICY WOULD COME FROM POTENTIAL AGREEMENTS WITH THE U S A AND JAPAN
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_21 BUT THEY WILL DO SO ONLY WHEN EUCRANIANS MANAGE TO FULFIL ALL THE AGREED AND OUTSTANDING CONDITIONS
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_19 BUT THEY WILL DO SO ONLY WHEN EUCRANIANS MANAGE TO FULFIL ALL THE AGREED AND OUTSTANDING CONDITIONS
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:34:51_10 INSTEAD OF WASTING MONEY FOR INTERNAL CONTROLS WE SHOULD STRENGTHEN THROUGH RESOURCES AND ENOUGH FINANCING THE EXTERNAL BORDERS OF THE UNION
20090915-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090915-19:04:10_15 IN THIS RESPECT IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP ON TECHNOLOGY WHICH AIMS AT DOUBLING INVESTMENT IN LOW CARBON TECHNOLOGY
20170404-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170404-10:00:04_5 FOR THE UPCOMING YEARS THEER CLASSICAL TECHNOLOGY IS BASED ON FOSSIL VIEWS AND THE ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS WILL BE PRESENT SIDE BY SIDE
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_22 THAT SHOULD BE A FIRST STEP IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING A FORWARD LOOKING EUROPEAN POLICY IN THE AREA OF FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGIES
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_18 SOME OPTIONS DOME SEEM TO BE MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN OTHERS AND WHO KNOWS THERE MAY BE OTHER OPTIONS WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN BROUGHT TO THE TABLE
20170703-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170703-17:34:14_23 TO CONCLUDE IN ITS CURRENT FORM THE DECISION GIVES US A THE GREEN LIGHT IF WE VOTE POSITIVELY TO MORROW FOR THE ETO MORDOVA
20160704-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20160704-17:48:37_2 ALWAYS SUFFERED QUITE A LOT OF DELAYS IN MANY RESPECTS AND ALWAYS WE WANTED TO HAVE OUR LIMITS LOWER AND HIGHER ET CETERA
20141124-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141124-19:43:56_5 AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN THE ON CONCRETE START UP OF THE PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
20171114-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171114-09:21:49_10 E CAN NOT ONLY LEAD BY EXAMPLE BUT MORE DECISIVELY USE SOFT AND HARD POWERS TO PERSUADE THE OTHERS THAT ARE MAKING THE GAME UNFAIR
20090203-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090203-09:54:38_5 M I THINK MEMBERS SAYE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER TO INTRODUCE A NETWORK OF CONTACT POINTS FOR THE PUBLIC TOUGH WIACH REPORT ILLEGAL AND HARMFUL CONTENT AND CONDUCT
20110705-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20110705-11:13:29_5 SO THE YU IS IN A HYPOCRITICAL SITUATION WHERE THE COUNCIL DOES NOT APPROVE JEMOS BUT SOME MEMBER STATES CULTIVATE THEM
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_22 TO CONCLUDE THIS DEBATE IS NECESSARY A DEBATE ABOUT FUTURE THAT WE WANT FOR OURSELVES AND FOR OUR CHILDREN
20170313-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170313-18:46:20_3 A SURVEY OF MEMBERS OF THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS SHOWED S M E FELT HIGH PAY IN SOME BIG BUSINESSES WAS HARMING THE REPUTATION OF ALL BUSINESSES

20170315-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170315-22:06:27_4 THE PROSPECT OF EUROPEAN INTIGRATION FROR MONTENEGRO AND THE WESTERN BALKANS IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL FOR PEACE IN THE REGION AND ACROSS EUROPE
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_10 AND FURTHERMORE PINTACK CAN ENABLE CROSS BORDER FINANCIAL FLOES AND INTERA STRUCTURE THROUGH ALTERNATIVE LANDING AND INVESTMENT CHANNELS
20130314-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20130314-15:35:00_5 THIS RESOLUTION IS NOT JUST FOR THE TURKMAN TOOR IT IS FOR ALL THE MINORITY COMMUNITIES OF IRAC WHO LONG FOR PEACE AND SECURITY
20110308-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20110308-17:10:15_4 THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONCIL DECISION ON TWENTY SIXTH OF APRIL TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR WOULD GREATLY ENCOURAGE TURKEY TO IMPLEMENT THE ISI TURKEY ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_6 THIS MEMORANDUM SETS OUT THE SUPPORTING POLICY MEASURES WHICH ARE CONDITIONAL FOR THE DISBURSEMENT OF THE FUNDS
20090421-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090421-17:43:34_4 I HAVE ER LODGED MY PAPERS WITH THE QUAURTER FIRST INSTANCE SO I INTEND TO FIGHT A VERY ROBUST CASE
20160412-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20160412-23:17:09_7 THIS IS HOW WE CAN MOST EFFECTIVELY TACKLE ALSO THE ROOD CAUSES OF OUR RECENT SECURITY AND MIGRATION CHALLENGES
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_24 SECONDLY THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE ECOMMERCE DIRECTIVE WERE GREAT BUT ITS GREATEST ISSUE WAS TRANSPARENCY
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_11 BUT AT THE SAME TIME OF COURSE WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THOSE FARMERS AND TO SEE HOW WE CAN HELP THEM BELLETING SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND E 
20101110-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20101110-20:00:29_2 AND IN THIS RESPECT I AM HIGHLY APPRECIATIVE OF COMMISSIONER BARNEER'S STRONG COMMITMENT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A CITIZEN'S CONCERNS AND ASPIRATIONS
20130418-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20130418-11:45:08_5 THERE HAS BEEN A MASSIVE LOBBYING CAMPAIGN AGAINST THIS PROPOSAL BY DE PORTS BUT IS ACTUALLY BASED ON INCORRECT INFORMATION
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_14 THEREFORE IT IS CRUCIAL THAT THE TWO UNFULFILLED ANTICORRUPTION MEASURES WILL BE PART OF THE NEW CONDITIONS
20090323-0900-PLENARY-8-en_20090323-17:13:31_5 ALL THESE PLACES HAVE EXPERIENCED REGULARLY IN BANKING CHALLENGES AND PROBLEMS EQUAL TO AND IN MANY CASES FAR WORSE THAN WHAT WE HAVE FACED IN IRELAND
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_12 THEREFORE IT IS CRUCIAL THAT THE TWO UNFULFILLED ANTICORRUPTION MEASURES WILL BE PART OF THE NEW CONDITIONS

20111212-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20111212-21:57:22_2 THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAVE DELIVERED THEY WE ASKED THEM FOR A ROAD MUP TO A LEGAL BINDING GLOBAL AGREEMENT
20170315-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170315-16:48:33_9 EDUCATING THE STAKE HOLDERS AND ACHIEVING LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE EFFECTS IS ONLY POSSIBLE BY AN APPROACH BASED ON SHARED RESPONSIBILITY
20130206-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130206-20:20:24_8 IT WILL SERIOUSLY HELP HELP US SPLEED UP THE PACE OF NEGOTIATIONS AND GIVE THE GLOBAL CLIMATE AGREEMENT A CHANCE
20170705-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20170705-22:50:15_6 IF WE TAKE SO LONG WITH A RULOFLAW COUNTRY LIKE SINGAPORE IMAGINE HOW LONG WE WILL TAKE WITH BIGGER MORE PROBLEMATIC COUNTRIES
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-11:29:19_3 AM TIME YOU TALKE TO US ABOUT A MARTIAL PLAN FOR AFRICA WHILE POLAND IS A COUNTRY WHICH DOES HAVE NO DEVELOPMENT MINISTRY NO DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND INVESTERO 
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_8 THIRD TO REFORM A PROCESS WHICH HAS BEEN IMPORTANT BUT IS NOT REALLY STEADIED UNTIL NOW
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_10 THIRD TO REFORM A PROCESS WHICH HAS BEEN IMPORTANT BUT IS NOT REALLY STEADIED UNTIL NOW
20170705-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20170705-21:39:25_5 AND THIS IS COMBINING A HELP ON ONE HAND EMERGENCY AS THE COMMISSIONER SAID AND PREVENTION FOR THE FUTURE
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_1 EQUALABORING AS A PART OF HE ACTION PLAN ON SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION CONSUMPTION AND INDUSTRIAL POLICY IS SUCH A TOOL
20170704-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170704-10:02:25_2 TOWARDS A TREATING THE ROOT CAUSES AND TREATING THE WHOLE ISSUE LOCALLY
20171212-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20171212-23:01:40_8 THE SECTORS MOST AFFECTED ARE MINING EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES ARGORY BUSINESS HYDRO ELECTRIC DAMPS AND WATER RIGHTS AND LOGGING
20170315-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170315-17:37:31_4 WE BELIEVE THAT LEGAL TRADE IS GOOD AND THAT TRADE IS MEANT TO SUSTAIN JOBS AND DAY PROSPERITY FOR PEOPLE AND FOR COMMUNITIES
20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_2 WE ALL AGREE IN THE LAST SESSION IN STRASBURG THAT DEVELOPMENT IS IMPORTANT BUT WE NEED TO REMEMBER IT NOW WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_7 INFRA STRUCTURE IN THE SCALEUP OF ELECTROLIZERS BUT ALSO IN CARBON CAPTURE UTILIZATION AND STORAGE BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE REALISTIC
20170704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170704-17:12:49_1 IAM NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL THE DETAILS IN WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO SUPPORT MANY ELEMENTS OF THE THREE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WORKED OUT IN THE PACKAGE
20171211-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20171211-21:30:34_1 NOW WE HAVE TO TAKE IT ONE STEP FURTHER BY EXPANDING IT TO THE WESTERN BALKAN CANDIDATE STATES ALREADY DURING THE ACCESSION NEGOTIATIONS
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_16 A STEP INTO THE RIGHT DIRECTION IS THE ADOPTION OF THE LAW ON HIGH ANTI CORRUPTION COUGT THIS LAST WEEK
20170315-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170315-16:48:33_11 STABILITY IN AFRICA AND IN ALL OTHER CONFLICT AREAS MIS MEANS LESS MIGRATION FLOWS TO THE EUROPEAN UNION
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_25 WE MUST AVOID ARTIFICIAL UNDER BUDGETING IN THE FUTURE AS WE ARE NOW ALL AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT SUCH AN APPROACH BRINGS
20101110-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20101110-20:00:29_6 IN MY OPINION THE SINGLE MARKET IS NOT GETTING THE POLITICAL SUPPORT URGENTLY NEEDED TO ASSURE IT DOESN'T BECOME YESTERDAY'S BUSINESS
20110203-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20110203-11:55:16_2 I THINK IT VERY STRANGE THAT A COMMISSION CANNOT COME UP WITH ONE SINGLE WOMAN THAT IS COMPETENT TO UNE OF THESE AUTHORITIES
20090504-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090504-17:16:47_1 I THINK MISTER PRESIDENT AT THIS HOUSE SHOULD SHOW SOME MEASURE OF HUMILITY AND SOME RESPECT FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS
20170703-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170703-17:34:14_6 SIXTY MILLION WOULD BE A LOAN AND FORTY MILLION WOULD BE A GRANT TO BE DISBERSED IN THREE INSTALMENTS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IDEALLY AND IN TN
20140312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20140312-21:46:07_12 WE FOUND OURSELVES IN AN ACADEMIC DEBATE IN A PROFESSIONAL DEBATE AND IN POLITICAL DEBATE
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_14 A STEP INTO THE RIGHT DIRECTION IS THE ADOPTION OF THE LAW ON HIGH ANTI CORRUPTION COURT THIS LAST WEEK
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:32:20_6 BUT SHANGEN WILL NOT BE COMPLETED UNTIL ALL MEMBERS WHO WANT TO BE PART OF IT HAVE THE CHANCE TO JOIN
20130314-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20130314-15:35:00_4 FOR ALL IRAKI CITIZEN IN GENERAL AND THE TURKMEN IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN NUMEROUSLY TARGETED ON A LARGER SCALE
20120214-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20120214-10:00:36_3 IN THE MIDST OF THIS EUROPEAN DEATH CRISIS WE ALWAYS TAKE THE DECISION TO FEAST CONSUME MORE NOW AND CREATE THAT FOR THE FUTURE
20150429-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20150429-22:59:14_1 AS IT IS THE INSTITUTION TAKING THE FINAL DECISION OR RATIFICATION BY THE UNION OF ANY INTERNATIONAL TREATY
20170912-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20170912-17:25:18_2 THEY WOULD HAVE SOME EFFECT BUT I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE ATTENTION OF THE LOOPHOLES
20130206-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130206-19:55:00_8 NORMALLY WE'RE VERY POLITE AND DON'T MENTION THEM BUT TO DAY I'D LIKE TO MENTION POLAND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE POLAND HAS BEEN BLOCKING
20090422-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090422-10:01:07_5 THE FACT IS THAT WE DO IN FACT REQUIRE ARAPTA PROTECTIONISM AND THOSE THAT MUST BE PROTECTED ARE WORKERS AND THE REAL ECONOMY
20150325-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20150325-16:04:24_4 SO DO YOU THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT ATTITUDE FOR THE COMMISSION TO TAKE OR IS IT IN CONFLICT WITH THEIR CLEAR AIM TO CREATE A DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET
20150325-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20150325-16:04:24_1 V A T RULES THAT WERE AGREED SEVEN YEARS AGO ARE HAVING ON MICRO ENTERPRISES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE INTERNET TO SET UP SMALL BUSINESSES
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_13 THE BULK OF THESE INVESTMENTS WAS MADE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ALSO ASIA AND ISRAEL ARE GEARING UP IN THIS RESPECT
20180116-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180116-20:56:23_13 WE DO NOT SEE CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT SANCTIONS COULD LEAD TO AN IMPROVEMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF T S D CHAPTERS
20130418-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20130418-11:45:08_7 THEY HAD BEEN WARNING AGAINST HUGE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS WHY THE IMPACT ASSESSMEN SAID IT'S A VERY EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATIVE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-08:34:44_19 SEE IMPROVEMENTS EVERY DAY A BUT WE FULLY REALIZE AS MEMBERS SAY  AN AS COUNCIL THAT WE ARE NOT DHERE YET AND THE LOT HAS TO BE DONE
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_1 AND I WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE WHAT WAS SAID BY A COMMISSIONER HOKEN THAT THE COMMISSION AND THE COUNCIL WERE NOT RESTING ON THEIR LOWERS
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_25 I WOULD LIKE TO CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ON ALL ASPECTS OF A STRATEGY
20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:52:32_6 RIGHTLY SO IT REMAINS WITH THE NATIONAL BUDGETS AND WITH THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND PARLIAMENTS BUT WE HAVE TO BECOME MORE EFFICIENT
20201005-0900-PLENARY-en_20201005-17:55:49_1 EU IS BUILT ON THE NATION THAT WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER AND THAT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND VALUES MUST NEVER BE AN ISSUE UP FOR CROMP COMPROMISE
20111213-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20111213-22:38:55_4 QUESTION THE VALIDITY OF REACH TO DO SO BECAUSE SO FAR WE HAVEN'T YET RESTRICTED ONE SINGLE SUBSTANCE USING THE REACH SYSTEM
20180910-0900-PLENARY-en_20180910-20:02:21_9  JOB TWO YEARS LATER THREE YEARS LATER TO SEE WHAT COMES OUT AND THE CONCLUSION IS CLEAR THE WORK FIXEDHE WORKED ONE
20171113-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171113-22:43:46_2 AND WE ALSO THING THAT A SINGLE MARKET FOR LITEL FINANCIAL SERVICES WHICH CAN RELY ON AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTION IS VERY WELCOME
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_6 AND WHATEVER THE PARTY POLITICAL LINES THAT PEOPLE WANT TO ADOPT ON THIS THIS IS THE TRUTH WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH HA PROBLEM OF GLOBAL BANKING RESTRUCTURING
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_5 THE PRINCIPLE OF NON CRIMINALIZATION IN THIS REGARD IS ALSO VITAL AND NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN ALL MEMBER STATES
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-10:12:09_10 BECAUSE MOST OF US BELIEVE THAT SITA IS GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY PARTICULARLY FOR ESSEMIS AND HE DOES NOT THREATEN OUR CHOICES VALUES OR LAWS
20131119-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20131119-20:04:13_5 GENDER TIVERCITY ON BOARDS LEADS TO MORE SUSTAINABLE DESISIONS AND THEREFORE A MORE RESISTANT EUROPEAN ECONOMY

20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_29 AS YOU KNOW FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENTS ON THE REVENUE SIDE IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIND AGREEMENT IN THIS DIRECTION
20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_6 IT FOLLOWS THAT IT CANNOT BE AND SHOULD NOT BE A PARTY TO SUCH INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT THIS ONE AND MANY OTHERS
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_4 HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY BE SERIOUS IN REACHING OUR CLIMATE GOALS WITHOUT TECHNOLOGIES LIKE CARBON CEPTURE BYOMAS OR NUCLEAR
20180116-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180116-10:45:18_5 TO OUR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE WE HAVE TO PASS NOT TITLES ON THEORETICAL TOPICS BUT ABOVE ALL PRACTICAL VALUES

20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-10:39:42_1 NO WAY THAN A PEACEFUL SOLUTION OUT OF THIS LONG ONGOING CONFLICT INTERNATIONAL PEACE NEEDS TO BE AN INTERNATIONAL END OVER
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_24 WE MUST BE CAUTIOUS WITH CREATING NEW RULES BECAUSE MUCH IS STILL UNCLEAR ABOUT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS OF FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGIES
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_5 WE FOUND THAT BANKS THAT WE THOUGHT WERE INDEPENDENT WERE COMPLETELY ENTANGLED WITH OTHER BANKS IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT PROBLEM
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-16:34:02_3 MALTA IS GEOGRAPHICALLY AND HISTORICALLY ONE OF THE GATES AND ONE OF THE DOORS OF THE EURUPEAN UNION
20151028-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20151028-17:37:47_6 ASK VERY MUCH COMMISSION AND COUNSIL TO PROVIDE US WITH THIS KIND OF CLEAR KNOWLEDGE WHAT WE MEAN BY NATIONAL SECURITY
20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-15:50:02_1 I WAS IN THEIARRIVALS HALLS WAITING TO GOUT THROUGH CUSTOMS WHEN WE HEARD AND FELT THE FIRST EXPLOSION
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_12 THE SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE ACCESSIBILITY ARE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AND BASED ON THE INTERNATIONAL WEB CONTENT ACCESSIBILITY GUIDE LINES TO
20140205-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20140205-17:15:29_2 IT IS AUTORIZED BY A U N SECURITY COUNCILLAR RESOLUTION IT COMPLEMENTS THE EFFORTS OF THE AFRICAN UNION FORCE
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_13 I WOULD NOW LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE PLANET GOVERNONCE SYSTEM WHICH IS PROPOSED FOR THE OPERATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THA STRATEGEM
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_14 WE HAVE NOT GRASPED THE IMPACT OF IT ON OUR DEMOCRACIES OUR CULTURE AND OUR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-16:04:50_1 IT'S THE MOMENT TO STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT TO JUST PAUSE AND TINK THROUGH THE IMPLICATIONS OF OUR ACTIONS UNTIL NOW
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-08:34:44_22 IT'S FULLY CLEAR THAT THEY HAVE RIGHT TO BE HUARD THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO A PROCEDURE THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO AN APPEAL AND THEIAR PROCESS REGULARLY
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_12 BAT THIS KIND OF OUR HYG CORPORATION BORN OF NEED IS THE KIND THAT WORKS BEST
20160704-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20160704-17:45:12_5 THIS PROPOSAL IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HOW TRADE IN A COMMON MARKET CAN ALSO DELIVER ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH BENEFITS FOR CITIZENS
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-16:34:02_2 TO THE COMMISSION AND TO THE MALTES AUTHORITIES IS TO GRANT RESPECT AND OBSERVATION OF THE RULE OF LAW
20151215-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151215-22:31:33_3 THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE BEHIND THIS IS THAT A FRONTIER WORKER SHOULD RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE COUNTRY IN WHICH HE OR SHE HAS CONTRIBUTED
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_16 THAT WILL BE ON THE AGENDA FOR THE DUNE COUNCIL TO BE DISCUSSED BY THE COUNCIL MEMBESTATES AND THE COMMISSION
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_7 OTHERWISE FOR THE CITIZEN UNLESS THERE IS THIS REALIZATION THIS WILL BECOME NOTHING MORE THAN A MEANINGLESS TIRED BUSWARD
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-21:57:09_7 THIS RENEWED POLICY DEFINITIVELY LEADS TO MORE LOCAL AND EUROPEAN ETE VALUE
20180416-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20180416-22:53:12_10 EUROPE HAS PROBABLY NEVER NEEDED SOLIDARITY AND EQUALITY MORE THAN TO DAY

20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_3 I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY STATING CLEARLY THAT THE MAIN TRUST OF THE COUNCIL'S POSITION IS THE PARARATIZATION OF EXPENDITURE

20180207-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180207-19:52:58_9 SO WE SHOULD KEEP FINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE AND FIGHDING THE TRADE OFFS TO BE FOCUSED AND EFFICIENT IN THE WORK AND E I B
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_7 GIVE GIBRALTAR REAL INFLUENCE AND A VOICE IN WESTMINSTER AND SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT GIBRALTAR IS NOT FOR SALE
20090204-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090204-09:07:32_2 THEIR TIRELESS EFFORTS HAVE GREATLY CONTRIBUTED TOWARDS SHAPING THE EU POSITION ON CLIMATE CHANGE
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:32:53_1 I WILL JUST UNDERLINE FOUR IDEAS THAT SEEM TO ME OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE ON THE SUBJECT
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_19 THE DIFFICULTY I CHALLENGE BEFORE US IS TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN DIDITAL PROGRESS AND RESPECT OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
20150909-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20150909-21:06:29_6 THIS MISMASS ON THE EUROPEAN LABOR MARKET CAUSES AN UNCOMPETITIVE EUROPEAN LABOR MARKET
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_18 RESPONSIBILITY MUST REST WITH THE RELEVANT MEMBER STATES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS DIRECTLY INVOLVED ON THE GROUND
20171212-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20171212-23:01:40_7 ENVIRONMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS LIKE HER ARE UNDER THREAT WHEN THEY OPPOSE THE INTEREST OF CORPORATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS
20170118-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170118-15:42:09_15 WE HAVE LINKS ALL OVER THE GLOBE TO THE ANGLER SPHERE THE COMMONWEALTH THE EMERGING MARKETS OF THE FAR EAST
20090325-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090325-10:58:27_6 SO IS THE COMMON REFRAIN THAT WE MUST LEARN THE LESSONS OF THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS GENUINE
20150427-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20150427-22:24:17_1 AND MUCH OF THE CREDIT FOR THAT GOES TO THE RAPORTEUR AND THE E C R WILL SUPPORT THIS REPORT IN PLENARY
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_25 WE MUST IMPROVE AND ENFORCE MEANFUL TRANSPARENCY WEN I CALL FOR A CLEAR MANDATE FROM THIS PARLIAMENT
20150519-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20150519-09:36:10_6 EXCESSIVE REGULATION COULD REALLY HARM THE ECONOMIES OF DEVELOPING WORD AND COULD ACTUALLY CAUSE JOBS THERE
20171113-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20171113-22:24:11_24 THIS IS WHY TO COMPLIMENT GIDYPE THE COMMISSION IS INVESTIGATING OTHER INDICATORS INCLUDING DEEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE
20180206-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180206-11:12:41_1 WE FIRST TOUGH IRELAND A VETERAN FORTY FIVE YEARS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT NOW WE HAVE CROATIA THE NEWEST ACCESSION
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_35 WE BELIEVE THAT SUCCESS BELONGS TO THOSE WHO CAN HARNESS POSITIVE FORCES THAT UNITE RATHER THAN DIVIDE
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_15 IF EUROPE WANTS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE RAPID INNOVATION SHOULD BE THE NORM NOT THE EXCEPTION
20090422-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20090422-23:01:25_5 WE NEED MORE DATA ON THE WIND SCREENS SO THAT WE CAN SORT OUT OUR OWN SALVATIONS IN A MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MANNER
20160525-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20160525-23:06:06_1 HUNGARY WHERE ONE CAN WITNESS CRONISM AT ITS FINEST IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE TO DEMONSTRATE THIS PROBLEM
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_25 WE BELIEVE IN CREATING BETTER CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH JOBS AND FOR HIGHER LIVING STANDARDS THROUGH THE UNION SINGLE MARKET
20180418-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180418-21:09:22_9 IN THIS REPORT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE COMMISSION AND THE NATIONAL COMPETITION AUTHORITIES
20170316-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170316-09:26:23_9 THIS REPORT IS THE TROJAN HORSE THE CUCKOO IN THE NEST THE FIFTH COLUMN THE HIDDEN ENEMY WITHIN
20171212-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20171212-23:01:40_9 AND THAT YOU AND ITS MEMBER STATES ARE CLEARLY NOT DOING ENOUGH TO INSURE CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND LEGAL REDRESS
20170426-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170426-16:44:25_4 AND NOW IT'S ABOUT A UNIVERSITY IT'S ABOUT ANGIOS IT'S ABOVE ALL ABOUT THE NEXT NATIONAL CONSULTATION
20090203-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090203-19:30:15_2 AND VERY OFTEN IN ECONOMIC ANDND ECONOMICALLY DIFFICULT TIMES YOUNG PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY GET INTO DRUG ABUSE
20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-16:49:49_4 THAT IS WHAT THE EUROPEAN CITIZENS ARE EXPECTING FROM ALL OF US AND THAT IS PRECISELY AND EXACTLY WHAT WE ASK FROM YOU
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-10:55:22_2 NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE DEMOCRACIES OF EUROPE AND THEREFORE TARKI SHOULD NEVER EVER BE ALLOWED TO JOIN THE EUROPEAN UNION
20171026-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171026-10:54:34_0 PRESIDENT ANY OPERATOR THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS
20130206-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130206-19:55:00_9 POLAND ARE NOW GOING TO BE PRESIDENT SO WE NEED TO PUT MAXIMUM PRESSURE ON POLAND TO LIVE UP TO THAT RESPONSIBILITY
20180312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20180312-19:49:50_8 MEAN I HOPE AND EXPECT THE COMMISSION TO TAKE THIS ON BOARD BECAUSE IT ALSO MEANS A LOT IN WHO WE ARE AS A PLAYER ON THE GLOBAL LEVEL
20180207-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180207-16:54:08_6 WE UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY OF PRODUCING A NEW LAW ON THE IMPORTANT SUBJECT OF THE EUROPEAN ELECTIONS
20090204-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090204-09:07:32_4 AS YOU KNOW THE WORK DURING THE PRESIDENCCY WILL FOCUS ON THE INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION PROCESS
20180205-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180205-20:59:23_11 ALREADY NOW I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE REVIEW IN TWO YEARS WHICH YOU HAVE JUST MENTIONED MISTER VICE PRESIDENT
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_16 IN ADDITION THE COMMISSION PROPOSES TO PLAY THE ROLE OF A FACILITATOR IN THE CASE OF DIFFICULTIES
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_24 I THINK THE FAR TRACK THE COMMISSION AND THE PARLIAMENT IS NOW ATTRIBUTING IS AN ACHIEVEMENT BECAUSE IT'S BOTTOM UP
20141021-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20141021-18:44:22_10 SPEND DAYS AND DAYS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER THE COUNCIL IS GOING TO RESPECT ITS COMMITMENTS OR NOT
20101110-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20101110-20:00:29_10 I REPEAT THAT MARKET INTEGRATION IS NOT AN AN IRREVERSIBLE PROCESS AND MUST NOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED
20090505-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090505-09:58:21_5 NATIONAL POWERS SHOULD HAVE A ROLE IN INVESTIGATING ANY RESTRICTION THAT SERVICE PROVIDERS IMPOSE
20171003-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20171003-20:01:37_6 IS THIS THE MODEL OF AVIATION WE WANT IN EUROPE OR ELSEWHERE A NEW MODEL OF LEGAL SLAVERY
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_3 THIS DEFINITION IS NOT THE ONE USED IN OUR REPORT BECAUSE IT WOULD EXCLUDE A LARGE AMOUNT OF RELEVANT ACTORS
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_35 SETA IS LIKE A LIGHTHOUSE FOR THESE GUIDE LINES FOR MANY WHO ARE SEARCHING FOR A WEALTH AND TRADE
20170201-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170201-21:37:18_5 THEY MUST TAKE SECOND PLACES PLAY SECOND FIDDLE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR PORTS AND OUR BOATS
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_20 SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE COUNCIL STANDS FULLY BEHIND THE EUROPEAN GENDA ON MIGRATION AS WAS AGREED BETWEEN US IND TWO 
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_5 RESTAURANTS MUST ALWAYS KEEP THE INFORMATION WHICH THEY RECEIVED WHEN THEY BOUGHT THE PRODUCT IN CASE CONSUMERS OR STATE AUTHORITIES ASKED FOR THEM
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_6 THE FIRST DIRECTION IS PROTECTIONISM PROVINCIONALISM DECLINE AND BUILDING OF WALLS
20130911-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20130911-19:09:22_17 I BELIEVE THAT ALL THESE AND OTHER ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS SHOULD BE BROKEN DOWN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_17 WEARE NOT AT A STAGE WHERE ER THE ER RISKS THAT COME WITH ANY SUCH TECHNOLOGY ARE SYSTEMIC
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_5 WE ARE THE EUROPEAN UNION WE SHOULD BE SETTING THE AGENDA NOT STRUGGLING OR EVEN FAILING P TO KEEP UP
20170705-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170705-11:22:54_4 THESE THREE GOALS MAY CERTAINLY FACILITATE A MORE INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE EUROPE
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_25 THE PUBLICATION OF THIS REPORT IS A REQUIREMENT OF THE COMMON MARKET ORGANIZATION FOR FISHERY AND AGRICULTURE REGULATION
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_3 IT IS ALSO SYMPTEMATICIC FOR ME THAT THE CLITERIS ALMOST EVERYWHERE HAS BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY NEGLECTED AND ERASED
20151027-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20151027-16:20:10_4 WE NEED TO SUPPORT IAZO IN ORDER THAT PEOPLE ARRIVING CAN HAVE THEIR ASYLUM APPLICATION PROPERLY PROCEED
20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_8 THESE IDEAS GOT A LOT OF SUPPORT IN THE NEGOTIATIONS BUT NOT ENOUGH IN ORDER TO BE ACCEPTED
20180530-0900-PLENARY-29-en_20180530-22:44:10_3 THIS IS VERY GOOD NEWS AS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE STARTEYS SUCCESS IS TO ASSURE EVERYBODY IS ON BOARD
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_19 TOGETHER WITH THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY THEY MAKE FOR THE CORPS PRIORITIES OF THIS REPORT
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_20 I FULLY AGREE THAT WE MUST ACT RESPONSIBLY AND ADDRESS AT THIS STAGE THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE IN PAYMENTS
20141124-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141124-19:43:56_8 WHAT WERE THE MAIN PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED AND BY WHICH MEMBER STATES
20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-16:04:50_3 AND THEREBY WEAKENING EFFECTIVE SECURITY AND OUR FREEDOMS TOGETHER WHICH WE DEFEND
20121022-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20121022-18:49:22_15 TO ENJOY PROTECTION BY THE DIPLOMATIC OR CONSONATE AUTHORITIES OF ANY MEMBER STATE IN A THERT COUNTRY
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_2 THE E I B HAS A LEAVERAGE OF ABOUT THIRTY FIVE TIMES AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS A MEMBER STATE GOVERNMENTS
20171115-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171115-10:11:28_16 THOSE POLES WE ARE STANDING UP FOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO BE PART OF EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND THAT IS WHY WE CARE
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_2 VINTACK IS OFTEN USED TO REFER TO A SPECIFIC SCENE OF STARD OPS DISRUPTING FINANCE WITH INNOVATION
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_9 BUT SAYING NO TO F J M ALSO DEMANDS THAT WE SAY NO TO ALL FORMS OF HATIARCHAL CONTROL OF OUR BODIES
20180205-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180205-19:21:11_3 THE AIM IS TO UNDERMINE THE WORK OF LEGISLATORS SUCH AS US AND AT THE SAME TIME MISLEASE CONSUMERS
20201005-0900-PLENARY-en_20201005-17:55:49_5 I WELCOME OF COURSE THE NEW RULE OF LA REPORT PRESENTED LAST WEEK BUT WE NEED TO GO FOR FURTHER
20170518-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20170518-11:03:16_7 TO ALLOW INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATION ON THE KILLINGS OF PROTESTERS ON GOVERNMENT SPONSORED LAND GRABS
20170705-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20170705-09:40:38_5 WE ALL KNOW VERY WELL THAT WE CANNOT PUT THESE PEOPLE INTO MY CLOSED INSTITUTIONS
20170314-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20170314-19:47:58_10 I ACTUALLY LISTEN TO MY CONSTITUENTS AND I KNOW THEY'RE FURIOUS ABOUT TAX DODGING BOTH BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS
20101110-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20101110-20:00:29_9 WE MUST NOT LOSE THIS POLITICAL MOMENTUM AND UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO REVITALIZE THE SINGLE MARKET
20170313-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170313-22:44:10_4 OUR COMMON VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF THE EU HAS TO BUILD ON OUR MOST CHERISHED ASSET WHICH IS OUR UNITY
20121212-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20121212-12:36:57_23 HUMAN RIGHTS WILL BE NO NOT MATTER JOTA
20140312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20140312-16:59:22_3 AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE DEFENCE PENDING IS OF COURSE AWFUL AND THE RELATIONSHIP WITH SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_9 THIS RAPID PROGRESS IS IMPORTANT IF WE ARE TO MAINTAIN MOMENTUM AS WE ENTER THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE OF THA STRATAGE
20170914-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170914-09:18:11_21 FIRST THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF MEMBERS STATES WHICH ARE CLEARLY IN FAVOR OF THE MANDATE
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_30 WE HAVE GOT TO DO THAT AND I BELIEVE THAT THE LESSON OF THIS CRISIS IS THAT WE ARE NOW IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY
20160526-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20160526-10:37:48_1 THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT IN THE AVERAGE CITIZEN'S EYES THE MARKET IS MORE CONCERNED WITH VESTED INTERESTS THAN IT IS WITH THEIR NEEDS
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_28 SO FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE I WOULD SAY THAT EVERY COUNTRY JUST LIKE MY SMALL COUNTRY LATWERE WILL BENEFIT OUT OF THIS
20130415-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130415-17:35:01_3 BECAUSE THIS IS A HUGE MASSIVE PROBLEM THAT NEEDS A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE WAY WE CONSUME AND PRODUCE ENERGY
20171113-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171113-22:43:46_15 MOREOVER WE'LL INVESTIGATE ANY BARRIERS THAT MAY PREVENT CONSUMERS FROM SUICHING TO BETTER OFFERS
20140312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20140312-21:46:07_2 IT IS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_15 IT WOULD HELP ORGANIZATION TO PROCEED MORE EASILY FROM ISOL TO IMA STANDARDS
20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_9 IF WE GET BACK FOR EXAMPLE TO THE ISSUE OF MIGRATION WE WILL SEE THAT THIS IS THE KEY QUESTION THE QUESTION OF GOVERNMENTS
20120614-0900-PLENARY-8-en_20120614-12:14:30_2 TWO THEY ALL CONCERNED THE SAME ISSUE THAT WE NOW LOST SO I PROPOSE THAT WE VOTE ALL OF THIS IN A BLOCK
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_3 THE PREVENTION OF TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS AND THE PROTECTION OF ITS VICTIMS MUST BE OUR PRIORITY GOAL
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_7 FROM PAST EXPERIENCE WE KNOW THAT CERTIFICATES ON VARIOUS LEVELS WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY COORDINATED
20170703-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170703-17:34:14_14 IF DONE PROPERLY IT IS MY STRONG BELIEF THESE REFORMS HAVE A HIGH POTENTIAL SYSTEMIC IMPACT
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_26 THAT BEDLOCK SHOULD BE FULLY ABSORBED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PAYMENT PLAN
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_23 THESE ARE THE VALUES THAT REFLECT THE SOUL OF THE UNION AND FORM THE CORE OF ANY FUTURE EUROPE
20170518-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20170518-11:03:16_9 AND TO PROVIDE UNRESTRICTED ACCESS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS AND ENGIOS TO ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
20170613-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170613-18:48:07_7 THERE IS NO WAY OUT AND IF YOU SAY IF HE SAYS WELL PERHAPS A MONTH OR TWO LATER I WILL NOT ACCEPT
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_18 CONSUMER PROTECTION AND THE STABILITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM SHOULD BE KEY CONCERNS IN THIS REGARD
20090324-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20090324-17:45:27_8 WILL ALLOW US TO GET A MUCH CLEARER IDEA OF OUR POLICY PERSPECTIVES ON TOP OF THE COMMISSION'S ANNUAL WORK PROGRAMMES
20180312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20180312-19:49:50_4 EN THE BOTTOM LINE HAS BEEN SAID HERE OVER AND OVER THERE HAS TO BE SOME STEPPING UP OF THE WORK THERE HAS TO BE SOME BINDING MEASURES
20090324-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090324-11:06:53_5 RESHAPING A  MICROCHETRIC FRAMEWORK CAN HELP US REINFORCE AND REBUILD OUR ECONOMIES FROM THE COMMUNITY UPWARDS
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_14 TRY TO FIND OTHER SOLUTIONS FOR OTHER EXISTING PROBLEMS BUT GO FORWARD WITH THIS DEAL
20141021-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20141021-17:48:50_5 WELL ORDERS ON TACK THE COMMISSION ACTION PLANS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED AND UP DATED
20130114-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20130114-22:44:27_8 THIS FILM GIVES ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS WHY DAVID ESAT MUST BE RELEASED IMMEDIATELY
20150909-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20150909-21:06:29_11 WE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE OF EUROPE NEED TO RETHINK LABOR MARKET POLICIES
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_20 N SENDING THEIR SOLDIERS IN THE FIRST WOLD WAR TO DEFEND OUR FREEDOMS AND OUR LIBERTIES
20130417-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20130417-21:14:12_4 SO I CALL UPON THE COUNCIL TO ACT ACCORDING TO LEGISLATION ACCORDING TO DEMOCRACY
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-21:57:09_22 SAND FORTY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WILL THE EXPERIENCE OF TWO THOUSAND FORTYEN TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BE REPEATED
20171026-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171026-10:54:34_1 HOWEVER THE DETERMINATION OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY SHOULD BE DOWN TO THE MEMBER OF STATE
20170614-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170614-11:29:47_2 AS WE HEARD A LOT OF OR OUR POLITICAL LEADERS IN EUROPE SAY THAT WE WOULD KEEP UP THE ENGAGEMENTS IN THE PARIS AGREEMENT
20151014-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20151014-17:52:50_3 THE REPORT IS RIGHT IN SAYING THAT WITHOUT THE CONTRIBUTION OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OUR GLOBALA EFFORTS WILL FAIL
20160705-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20160705-18:52:45_9 SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION WILL BE AN IMPORTANT COMPLEMENT OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATED BOARDER MANAGEMENT
20140415-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20140415-11:40:39_3 IF YOU WANT TO GET RID OF ALL THESE E PROBLEMS YOU MENTION THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY
20180206-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180206-18:17:12_4 THAT WOULD GIVE THE ENLARGEMENT A MORE PROMINENT PRESENCE SUPPLEMENTING THE USUAL PROGRESS REPORTS FOR THE COUNTRIES
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_14 AMONG THEM IS A LINE IN THE DEFINITION OF IMAS WHICH I SAW PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_7 BEING USED BY MANY F G M APTERISTS THAT FIGHT AGAINST F G M BUT IT GIVES US THE POWER TO PROTECT IT
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_32 WE WANT TO HAVE MORE OF AN AMBITION BUT WE WANT TO ALLIN CEOTO REDUCTION AND COMPETITION
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_10 I AGREE WITH PRESIDENT JUNKER THAT THE TIME HAS COME TO ALLYING EXPECTATION WITH REALITY
20140312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20140312-16:57:27_4 POLITICIANS SHOULD HAVE ACTED MUCH EARLIER IN PREVENTING THE CRISIS THEY FAILED TO REACT IN TIME
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-21:57:09_8 SEE COMMITMENTS IN THE SOCIAL FIELD ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE TO BRING INTO A JOB
20171026-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171026-10:54:34_7 THE REPORT CALLS FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF A EUROPEAN FUND FOR THE REMEDYING OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_17 PRIVATE SECTOR NEEDS TO GET INVOLVED AND PLAY A ROLE THROUGH ITS EXPERTESS AND INNOVATION NOHOW
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_34 IN OUR POSESSION NOT AN AGREEMENT WITHIN THE LEGAL MEANING OF ARTICLE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN OF THE TREATY
20170914-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170914-09:18:11_20 THREE DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THE MANDATE CAN BE DISTINGUISHED AT THIS ESTATE IN THE COUNCIL
20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:52:32_4 WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT FINANCING MILITARY OPERATIONS OUT OF OUR BUDGET IN FUTURE
20160510-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20160510-10:53:57_0 THANK YOU CHAR YOU MENTIOND THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES IN USE AND EMPLOYMENTR YOU MENTION SPAIN AND
20170315-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170315-22:06:27_7 MY GROUP TABLED A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO THE REPORT SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON ENHANCING HUMAN RIGHTS
20180115-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20180115-20:12:26_7 THE FACT IS OTHER THAN A SMALL REDUCTION OVER ALL FUEL USAGE THERE IS NO ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT
20170406-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170406-09:41:23_3 ROMA PEOPLE HAS BEEN SUFFERING ALL THROUGH THE EUROPEAN HISTORY BUT ALSO THE SITUATION HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER
20110705-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20110705-11:13:29_3 GOVERNMENTS FEEL THE SCEPTICISM OF PUBLIC OPINION AND TRY TO TRANSFER RESPONSIBILITY TO THER COMMISSION
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_5 THE HISTORIC LEGACY OF ENLIGHTENMENT IS VERY MUCH RELATED TO THAT
20170313-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170313-18:46:20_6 THE MESSENGEIS DIRECTIVE SENDS MUST BE HEEDED ACROSS THE EU AND IN BRITAIN INCLUDING AFTER BREXET
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-23:10:55_7 AND THIS MEANS THAT YOU LOOK AND TELL US HONESTLY WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF YOU START THREE YEARS LATER
20150611-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150611-10:25:51_3 AS MY COLLEAGUE BORIS JOHNSON THE MAYOR OF LONDON HAS PUT IT THIS IS NOT A CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS
20171129-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20171129-17:20:25_8 WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY DEAR COMMISSIONER TO TAKE UP A FULL RESPONSIBILITY AND AMBITION AND TAKE THE SITE OF THE PARLIAMENT
20120703-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120703-20:30:20_0 THE PRESIDENT EVEN THOUGH I THOUGHT I GOT YOUR MESSAGE THAT I SHOULDN'T ASK FOR THE FLOOR I DO IT ANYWAY
20110706-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20110706-17:26:49_7 OF COURSE WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO SUPPORT THE FORCES AND MOVEMENTS WITH ISLAMIS IDEAOLOGY
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-19:52:40_14 MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO AVOID ER THISR WE CANNOT SIMPLY SUPPORT THIS FIGHT AS IT STANDS NOW
20180612-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180612-19:52:40_14 MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO AVOID ER THIS WE CANNOT SIMPLY SUPPORT THIS FIGHT AS IT STANDS NOW
20180531-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180531-15:00:20_4 I THEREFORE HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR THE HIGH REPRESENTATIVE A ON  A RESPONSE FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:34:51_2 AS IT WAS ALREADY SAID IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THE EUROPEAN UNION TO DAY WITHOUT SHANGEN
20151027-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20151027-16:20:10_5 A I AS WONDER WHY EUROPER SHOULD RECEIVE THE SAME INCREASE IN FUNDING AND STUFF AS EAZO
20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_18 I THINK THAT WE SHOULD PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO DEVELOPMENT ISSUES ALSO IN THAT REPORT
20180530-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180530-16:04:28_2 AND GOLDEN VICIAS MAKE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE STATUS OF E RESIDENCE AND CITIZENSHIP
20120523-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20120523-10:20:54_6 AND I'M PREPARED TO PAY MORE TAXES BUT  THEY HAVE TO BE FAIR AND THEY HAVE TO BE GOOD TAXES
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_14 OWE'RE SEEING IMPROVEMENTS WE'RE SEEING POSITIVE EFFECTS ALREADY BUT WE ALSO REALIZE THAT THERE A LOT HAS TO BE DONE
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_5 SERVICES AND PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS DIRECTIVES CONSUMER REDRESS AND DESEMIS INCENTIVES
20150427-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20150427-22:24:17_3 NOT JUST MOTHERHOOD AND APPLE PIE TO USE THE AMERICAN EXPRESSION BUT IT IS OF SOME REAL VALUE
20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_8 WE NEED TO INVEST IN TRY NEIGHBORS OF DEVELOPMENT AND YES MOST OF ALL WE NEED TO INVEST IN GOOD GOVERNORS
20130911-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20130911-19:09:22_5 SOME INFLUENTIAL EUROPEAN POLITICIANS BELIEVE THAT BELLARAS IS LOST FOR THE IJU
20171004-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171004-11:32:31_2 THE EUROPEAN UNION IS KNOWN AS A SOFT POWER AND THIS IDENTITY SHOULD BE PRESERVED AND DEVELOPEDS
20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_8 THE GERMAN SURVEILLANCE SCHEME ON EIGHTEEN TO FORTY YEARS OLD MOSLEM MEN IN GERMANY WAS NOT EFFICIENT
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_16 FOR THIS VERY REASON THERE IS A NEED FOR PUBLIC PRIVATE CORPERATION BASED ON DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_4 IT IS CRITICAL THAT CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS TO COMPLETE INFORMATION IN ORDER TO MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE
20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_4 WE STILL NEED TO FIX THAT PROBLEM BECAUSE THE COMMUNICATION DATA NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED IN A SPECIFIC WAY
20150429-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20150429-22:59:14_3 AS I HAVE SAID DISCUSSION ON THE COMBATANTS IS A VERY DIFFICULT AND SENSITIVE ONE
20201005-0900-PLENARY-en_20201005-17:55:49_7 SO ONE OF THE BEST WAY OF PROVIDING THE TIGER WITH TEETH IS THROUGH A STRONGER CONDITIONALITY LINKED TO THE BUDGET
20180228-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180228-17:14:28_4 THE CANDIDATE WE HAVE TO APPROVE ITS PROGRAME AND WE HAVE TO APPROVE THE COLLEGE
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_26 THE COMMISSION VERY MUCH EXPECTS THE PARLIAMENT TO BE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN EVENTS SUCH AS THE ANNUAL FORUM
20180614-0900-PLENARY-en_20180614-12:20:00_4 NOMADIC DRIVING DRIVERS HAVE A NEW RIGHT TO GO BACK HOME BY THE END OF MAXIMUM THREE WEEKS
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-10:39:42_3 I'M GLAD THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS READY TO ASSIST ANY UNITS TO SUPPORT THE ONGOING PROCESS IN O S C E
20090422-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090422-10:01:07_4 THE FACT IS THAT THE EU RESPONSE TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS HAS BEEN SLUGGISH HAS BEEN MINIMALISD
20180418-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180418-21:09:22_5 AS YOU KNOW THIS IS A NON BINDING REPORT BUT IT SENDS A STRONG POLITICAL MESSAGE TO THE COMMISSION
20090422-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20090422-21:33:05_1 AND UNFORTUNATELY EVEN THE CHANGES INTRODUCED BY COMMITTEE DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH IN IMPROVING THE PROPOSAL
20171004-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20171004-16:31:37_4 AS THE CONSEQUENCE COUNTRY SOON AFTER SUFFER WITH SUBSTANTIAL DIFFICULTIES AND PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_31 AND THE PROGRESS REGISTERED ON THE FUTURE OF EUROPE MUST BE FOLLOWED UP AND TRANSLATED INTO ACTION
20180910-0900-PLENARY-en_20180910-21:31:20_13 FOR EXAMPLE IN  FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE PUBLISHED A STAFF DOCUMENT TO EXPLAIN OUR APPROACH
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_14 COULD USE IT FOR DELIGITTLE WRIGHTS MANAGEMENT FOR MUSIC FILMS OR ELECTRONIC FOOTBALL TICKETS
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_4 AND ALL THIS HAS TO BE ACHIEVED WITHIN VERY TIGHT FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND VERY TIGHT BUDGETORY SEILINGS
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_18 IT IS ALSO NECESSARY THAT SUCH INFORMATION BE RELIABLE MEANING IT MUST BE CONTROLLED IN A VERY STRICT MANNER
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_23 WE ARE AWAITING THIS EXTERNAL STRUCTURE AND HOPE THAT THIS INFORMATION WILL BE EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO CONSUMERS
20180205-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180205-20:59:23_6 THERE IS NO PLACE FOR PROTECTIONISM IN OUR COMMON EUROPEAN MARKETS
20170406-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170406-09:41:23_6 PLEASE ADDRESS THAT IN YOUR REPLY AND DO NOT CONTINUE TO ATTACK THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MOVING CROSS BORDERS
20130206-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130206-19:55:00_5 THIS WILL ONLY HAPPEN IF THE EU SHOWS DIRECTION AND TO BE HONEST WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT FOR A FEW YEARS
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_7 MAKING WEB SITES AND THEIR CONTENT USIBLE FOR ALL SHOULD HAVE ALREADY BECOME A PRIORITY AT EOU LEVEL
20131008-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20131008-11:22:06_2 IT IS THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE HAVE TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS ABOUT UPCOMING PROJECTS
20090506-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20090506-11:09:20_2 A THE BUDGET COMMITTEE RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE PROPOSALS AND THE URGENCY
20170912-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170912-09:47:35_5 THIS IS EXACTLY THE MOMENT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD STEP IN AND SOME OF THEM DO IT BUT SOME OF THEM DON'T
20130415-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130415-17:35:01_2 WE'VE JUST ADOPTED A ENERGY EFFICIENCY DIRECTIVE THAT WILL DEFINITELY ALSO PUT US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_14 THE U S CHINA AND ISRAEL HOST MORE THAN HALF OF THE TOP TEN LARGEST FINTAK COMPANIES
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:58:09_5 URAN SEES SOME OF ITS CITIZENS AS THREATS REPRESSION HAPPENS TO REAL PEOPLE PEOPLE WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS
20201008-0900-PLENARY-en_20201008-11:26:32_2 FOR NINETEEN YEARS HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILDREN HAVE TRIED TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO GET HIM RELEASED
20090324-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090324-11:06:53_1 THE ECONOMIC CRISIS HAS FORCED US TO TAKE A LONG AD HARD LOOK AT OUR PAST AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-22:17:13_24 FOR TWO THOUNSRED SEVENTEEN AND WE WANT TO KEEP THE MAIN FORECUST OF THESE DISCUSSIONS ON TWO THOUSED SEVENTEEN BUDGET
20130314-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20130314-15:35:00_2 THIS ATTACK CLAIMED THE LIFE OF A FURTHER FORTY TWO ETHNIC TURKMAN AND WOUNDED ANOTHER ONE
20180614-0900-PLENARY-en_20180614-12:20:00_6 FOR THE FIRST TIME COMMON STRONG ENFORCEMENT IS POSSIBLE BY USING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE
20130612-0900-PLENARY-8-en_20130612-13:27:28_0 YES THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT ITS JUST TO SAY THAT I THOUGHT MY NAME WOULD BE AMONG THE SIGNATURES ON THIS RES
20141021-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20141021-18:44:22_12 THE DECISION ON ALL THE WHOLE SET OF  AMENDING BUDGETS COULD BE MADE VERY EASILY
20171003-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171003-11:25:07_4 FORTUNATELY FOR THE TIME BEING IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE ARE NOT ON THE WAY TO REDUCE THIS UNCERTAINTY
20140312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20140312-16:57:27_6 ING WELFARE SYSTEMS IS PAINFUL BUT IT IS NECESSARY TO INSURE STABILITY AND FUTURE GROWTH
20180205-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180205-21:11:01_9 I BELIEVE THAT BETTER COLLECTION OF TAXES SHOULDN'T BE USED FOR INCREASING OF THE GOVERNMENT REVENUES
20150909-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20150909-21:06:29_5 IT IS UNFORTUNATE FOR OUR SOCIETIES WHICH MISS OUT WEALTH AND PROSPERITY
20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:52:32_2 APART FROM THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO REPEAT WRONG THINGS AND IT DOESN'T MAKE THEM MORE TRUE
20171211-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20171211-21:30:34_3 THIS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO THE ECONOMISTS TOO THROUGH MARKET INTEGRATION AND BETTER SERVICES
20130206-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130206-19:55:00_7 ATAND I THINK YOU STRUGGLE AND I THINK YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO ADMIT THAT SOMETIMES SOME COUNTRIES ARE BLOCKING
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:43:11_20 UNION AND I AM ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT IN THOSE DAYS SHE WOULD FULLY AGREE WITH WHAT I HAVE JUST STATED
20180614-0900-PLENARY-en_20180614-12:20:00_10 MINIMUM WEIGHTES MIGHT BEGUM A NEW NORM AND YOU SHOULD ALL BE AWARE OF THAT
20130312-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20130312-21:52:39_7 THIS HOW IS STILL DELIBERATING ON THE APPROACH TO BE TAKEN FOR THE REVISION OF THIS DIRECTIVE
20180614-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20180614-12:20:00_9 MINIMUM WEIGHTES MIGHT BECOM A NEW NORM AND YOU SHOULD ALL BE AWARE OF THAT
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_8 EVEN AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY INTERESTING WHEN THEREIS NOCENTRAL AUTHORITY IN PLAY
20171115-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20171115-12:41:10_2 HE HAS MADE NO EFFORT AT ALL TO SPEAK WITH THE E F D D AS A GROUP
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-11:24:15_60 MANY CASES AS WE ALL KNOW DEY FAIRMUNCS DISAGREE AND THAT HALVS TO DEBATE ALSO IN THOSE AREAS
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_6 NAMELY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CLOUD COMPUTING AND DISTRIBUTED LEGER TECHNOLOGY
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_15 INSTEAD WE HAVE FOCUSED ON VOLUNTARY CO OPERATION WHICH IS GOOD BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH
20090423-0900-PLENARY-25-en_20090423-21:41:42_5 THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY DOES NEED A REGULATION AFTER TWENTY YEARS OF HAVING THE DIRECTIVE IN PLACE
20180208-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180208-15:06:14_15 A HIGH LEVEL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCTION IS OF COURSE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR THE COMMISSION
20170118-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170118-15:42:09_9 I AM HOWEVER GLAD THAT THE PRIME MINISTER MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE ARE LEAVING THE SINGLE MARKET
20141021-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20141021-18:44:22_1 WE HAVE A UNIQUEST SITUATION TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH NO EXPENSES FOR THE MEMBERS THAT
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_23 THE INTENTION OF THIS REPORT IS NOT TO PROPOSE SPECIFIC LEGIS LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS
20180116-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180116-20:56:23_2 THE BENEFITS OF GLOBALIZATION DO INDEED HAVE TO REACH ALL CITIZENS AND ALL COMMUNITIES
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_8 TIME IS RUNNING SHORT AND THE CONTINUED UNITY AND INTEGRATION OF THE MARKET ARE BEING SERIOUSLY THREATENED
20090323-0900-PLENARY-8-en_20090323-17:13:31_1 THE IRISH SYSTEM WORKS WITHIN A LEGAL AND REGULATORY POLICY DIRECT THE FRAMEWORK DICTATED BY THE E U
20171115-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171115-10:11:28_7 THIS IS THE WAY IN WHICH THIS POLISH AUTHORITY THIS POLISH GOVERNMENT THIS POLISH MAJORITY ACTS
20180702-0900-PLENARY-en_20180702-21:01:48_5 HOWEVER IT IS A STEP THAT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
20170705-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20170705-21:39:25_1 EFFICIENT IN OUR OUR SUPPORT AND LET ME TOUCH A COUPLE OF THINGS THE COMMISSIONER ALSO SAID ABOUT IT
20110203-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20110203-11:55:16_1 I WILL BRING TO THE ATTENTION TO THIS HOUSE THAT NONE OF THOSE THREE ARE A WOMAN
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_4 MANY PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AND THE DICTIONARIES IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN STILL GET IT WRONG
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:34:51_8 SECOND THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS WILL BRING BENEFITS TO ALL CITIZENS OF THE EUROPEAN UNI
20180312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20180312-19:49:50_11 S IS GOING TO TAKE GENERAL QUALITY FURTHER AND AND SOCIAL RIGHTS IN EOTRADIUS IF WE DON'T DO IT
20170426-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170426-16:44:25_1 WE'VE WITNESSED SEVERAL UNSPEAKABLY WORDED NATIONAL CONSULTATIONS IN THE MEANTIME
20160705-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20160705-18:52:45_10 THE AGENCY IS TASKED WITH SUPPORTING MEMBER STATES IN CARRYING OUT THESE OPERATIONS
20150429-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20150429-22:59:14_4 WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL ROUNDS OF DISCUSSION IN ATTEMPTS TO FIND A SOLUTION
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_7 ACCOUNTABILITY NEEDS TO BE INSURED FOR BOTH OFFENDERS AS WELL AS KNOWING USES
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-15:10:37_7 EUROPE IS ABOUT JUSTICE ABOUT SEPARATION OF POWERS AND ABOUT RULE OF LAW
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_17 IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT OUR GOAL WE CANNOT SLOW DOWN TO PROCEDURES
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_9 DOES THE COMMISSION AGREE ON THIS AND HOW DOES IT INTEND TO ADDRESS THIS IN THE NEW STRATEGY
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_6 IN THAT CONTEXT I WOULD LIKE TO HIGLIGHT THREE KEY ELEMENTS
20171003-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20171003-18:00:00_2 BUT TO DAY I WANTED TO RAISE A SPECIFIC SITUATION OF ELGIBITIA PERSONS BEING PERSECUTED
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_3 THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ENABLE US TO SOLVE MANY OF THEIR CRITICAL PROBLEMS CONFRONTING US
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_2  FIRST OF ALL THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE WORLD COMES TOGETHER TO DEAL WITH THIS CRISIS
20180502-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180502-15:01:39_3 WE DO APPRECIATE THE OWN RESOURCES ALTHOUGH WE WOULD HAVE WANTED TO HAVE MORE AMBITIONS A OUR OWN RESOURCES
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_19 IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT OUR GOAL WE CANNOT SLOW DOWN TO PROCEDURE
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_2 OF COURSE IT IS NOT A COMPLETE SURPRISE TO ME THAT THE PARLIAMENT IS TAKING SUCH AN INTEREST IN THE STRATAGY
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_7 IN THAT CONTEXT I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIHT THREE KEY ELEMENTS
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_2 VICTIMS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS NEED TO BE PUT AT THE CENTRE OF ALL EFFORTS
20171026-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171026-10:54:34_6 THIS IS TYPICAL OF THE E U IMPLEMENTING MORE AND MORE UNNECESSARY LEGISLATION
20120705-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20120705-10:01:00_3 WE ALL WANT IT MORE IN REOL BUT IT'S NOT TRUE THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN ACHIEVEDLET
20160412-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20160412-23:17:09_1 DEVELOPMENT WAS LIFTED ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH DIPLOMACY AND DEFENSE
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_3 LACK OF PROPER TRANSPOSITION AND THENFORMATION POTENTIAL OF THE DIGITAL MARKET
20140312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20140312-21:46:07_17 AND WERE APPROPRIATE PROPOSAL FOR AES REGULATION CHANGES
20170201-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170201-18:15:33_1 MOST OF THESE PEOPLE WILL COME FROM LIBYA INTO ITALY VIA PEOPLE TRAFFICKERS AS WE KNOW
20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-15:50:02_2 AND THEN THE SECOND EXPLOSION AND SOME OF US THOUGHT THAT THE ROOF WAS COMING DOWN UPON US
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-22:17:13_10 IF I MAY JRUST VERY BRIEFLY TO SOME OF THE IMPORTANT POINTS WHICH WERE MADE DURING THE DISCUSSION
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_3 BUT OF COURSE ONE WOULD BE WRONG BECAUSE THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY HAS A LOT OF PROMISE
20090324-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090324-11:12:24_5 THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT AND ESSENTIAL AT THIS TIME IN THE ECONOMIC SITUATION
20150909-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20150909-21:06:29_3 THIS MISS MATTS IS UNFORTUNATE FOR MANY EUROPEANS WHO ARE OUT OF WORK
20170315-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170315-22:06:27_5 AS THE COMMISSIONER NOTED MONTENEGRO CONTINUES TO DEMONSTRATE A STRONG COMMITMENT TO EU INTEGRATION
20171026-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171026-09:32:35_1 THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF THE U K IS VERY DIFFERENT TO THE REST OF CONTINENTAL EUROPE
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_25 EVERY SINGLE MEMBER EVERY SINGLE COMMITTEE AND EVERY SINGLE BODY OF THIS HOUSE MUST BE INBOLVED
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_1 OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THAT THE PERFECT IS BECOMING THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_9 WE ARE ALREADY FEELING UNFORTUNATELY THE EFFECTS OF PROTECTIONISM IN VARIOUS WAYS
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_16 EU PITO SANITARY RULES REMAIN FULLY APPLICABLE TO UCRANIAN PRODUCTS
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:32:20_4 THEY EXIST ONLY ON MAPS AND IN THE HEADS OF THOSE WHO WANT TO DESTROY THE UNION
20090324-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20090324-17:45:27_5 WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE SPENDING ALL THEIR TIME EVALUATING THEMSELVES WHEN THEY SHOULD BE GETTING ON AND DOING SOME WORK
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:34:51_6 THAT'S ABOUT CREDIBILITY IF WE AS UNION FOLLOW OUR OWN RULES
20090324-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20090324-17:45:27_3 IS LEFT IN THE BUDGET BECAUSE WE CAN'T CHANGE THINGS BECAUSE OF THE RESTRICTIONS OF THE M F F
20090506-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20090506-11:09:20_1 ANLIKE MISTER HOPPINS DOUBTLESS WILL BE MY LAST SPEECH BEFORE THIS CHAMBER AFTER TWENTY YEARS
20180315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20180315-09:39:17_2 SECOND WHAT IS THE STATE OF PLAY ON THE MEMBER STATE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES
20090324-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090324-11:06:53_4 AND ADDRESSING AN IMPROVING ACCESS TO MICRO CREDIT OFFERS US THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDRESS THESE PAST MISTAKES
20160704-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20160704-17:45:12_9 OVER ONE THIRD OF THE U CASE AIR POLLUTION IS BLOWN IN FROM ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_11 WE HAVE NOW CREATED INSURANCE SCHEMES AND OTHER SCHEMES TO DEAL WITH THE IMPAIRED ASSET
20090423-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20090423-12:07:10_3 NOT ONLY HAVE I HAD NO ANSWER BUT HIS OFFICE REFUSED TO RESPOND TO MY EMALES
20150210-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150210-12:38:08_10 ARE YOU PLANNING TO PUT FORWARD A PROPOSAL FOR AN ACTION PLAN ON THIS ISSUE
20170913-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170913-11:45:22_1 THIS MEANS THAT LIFE FOR PEOPLE IN EUROPE IS BETTER AND THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE EXPECT FROM US
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_27 A STRONG EUROPE IS NEEDED TO BRING ABOUT THE RIGHT BALANCE IN A WORLD ORDER WHICH IS SHIFTING
20171025-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171025-15:58:29_4 TO EXTERNALIZE BORDERS THE WAY WE SEE THAT SOME PEOPLE HERE WANT TO DO IS NOT TO SAVE PEOPLE
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_21 THIS INVENTORY WILL ENABLE AN ANALYSIS OF THE CERTIFICATION SYSTEMS OF THESE CLAIMS
20201008-0900-PLENARY-en_20201008-11:26:32_3 DREAMING AND PEACEFULLY ACTING FOR DEMOCRACY MUST NEVER BE A CRIME
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:27:34_6 ALTERNATIVE MEANS THAT TO FIND A SOLUTION IS WELCOME BECAUSE BEJING WILL SELL ITS ARMS
20130114-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20130114-22:44:27_4 IT IS A TRAGEDY THAT THIS CAN GO ON YEAR AFTER YEAR WITHOUT ANYTHING IS HAPPENING
20170704-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170704-11:31:41_10 WE TOOK MANY MEASURES TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION AND I BELIEVE WE REACHED A CERTAIN IMPROVEMENT
20170705-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170705-11:22:54_1 STONIA HAS CHOSEN FOUR MAIN OBJECTIVES FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS
20180530-0900-PLENARY-30-en_20180530-22:53:56_4 LET ME OUT LINE BRIEFLY WHAT THE COMMISSION IS ALREADY DOING TO IMPROVE ITS UPPLEMENTATION
20150519-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20150519-16:18:27_4 SO VISIBLE UNDERSTANDABLE NOT ONLY AMONG OURSELVES BUT ALSO MORE AND MORE OUTSIDE
20180418-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180418-21:09:22_25 AND FINALLY YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE UES LAST WEEK I HOPE YOU HAD INTERESTING MEETINGS
20171115-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171115-10:11:28_8 AND SOPHYE INNDEFELD WAS TOTALLY RIGHT WHEN SHE EXPLAINED THAT IT'S APODECTIC IT'S ABSOLUTE
20180614-0900-PLENARY-en_20180614-10:46:02_5 HOLEK SENSHOV'S CASE IS NO LONGER JUST A JUDICIAL OR POLITICAL ONE
20090325-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090325-10:58:27_3 FREE MARKET THEOLOGY MUST NOT STAND IN THE WAY OF DOING RIGHT BY WORKERS
20180910-0900-PLENARY-en_20180910-19:34:04_7 WE MUST STRIVE TO DEFEND IT AND MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO FARTHER INCREASE ITS EFFECTIVENESS
20160705-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20160705-18:52:45_14 I KNOW THAT THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE NOT CONVINCED ABOUT THIS NEW AGENCY
20180614-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180614-10:46:02_5 KOLEKSENSHOV'S CASE IS NO LONGER JUST A JUDICIAL OR POLITICAL ONE
20090204-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20090204-17:04:59_2 SO WE HAVE A EUROPEAN ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN OF WHICH THE CAR INDUSTRY IS A PART
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_12 IT IS THE DUTY OF MEMBER STATES TO GUARANTEE THAT THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AND ACCURATE
20171114-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171114-09:21:49_3 HARMING COMPETITION THEY ARE CREATING UNFAIRWAY INCREASING INEQUALITY
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_13 MAMMERSTAKES MUST IMPLEMENT SANCTIONS WHICH ARE EFFICIENT PROPORTIONATE AND DISSUASIVE
20110706-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20110706-17:26:49_5 WE HAVE TO STOP ALL SUPPLIES OF MILITARY EQUIPMENTS TO THE UNDEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION
20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-15:50:02_9 WE NEED TO SPEAK OF OUR GENDERA QUALITY WE NEED TO COUNTERACT PHRASES IN XENOPHOBIA AND ISAMOPHOBIA
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_6 AND THAT'S SOMETHING SIMILARLY THAT OUR COMMITTEE IN THE PARLIAMENT HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF
20180115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20180115-18:04:58_5 SO YOU HAD A VERY ENERGY EFFICIENT AIRPLANE AND THEN IT COULD FLY ON SOLAR
20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_8 HAPPILY WE HAVE THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY IT AND PLAY IT REPEATEDLY
20121212-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20121212-17:51:19_2 THE PROBLEM HOWEVER IS THAT OUR CURRENT POLICY SEEMS NOT TO BE WORKING
20170703-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170703-17:34:14_8 RESULT HAS BEEN EVEN STRONGER CONDITIONALITIES ATTACHED TO THE DISBURSEMENT OF EACH OF THE THREE INSTALMENTS
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-20:25:31_5 THE RECENT COMMISSION STATEMENT OF ESTIMATES SHOWED THAT THE YUKE WOULD BE HANDED OVER
20170518-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170518-15:04:33_8 SO FAR THE COMMISSION HAS RECEIVED TWENTY ONE REPLIES FROM THE MEMBER STATES
20180910-0900-PLENARY-en_20180910-20:02:21_10 GOOD RESULTS AND EVEN WITH MORE CAPACITY TO PERFORM IN THE FUTURE
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_15 FURTHER INFORMATION OF FISH CAN BE ADDED TO A LABEL AS AN ADDITION TO COMPULSORY INFORMATION
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_9 THE IMCO COMMITTEE WAS MORE AMBITIOUS AND MADE A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO THE TEXT
20180704-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20180704-20:25:31_5 THE RECENT COMMISSION STATEMENT OF ESTIMATES SHOWED THAT THE YUKIR WOULD BE HANDED OVER
20170613-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20170613-22:37:50_7 TEN WEEKS AGO STABILIZATION AND ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO FORCE
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_6 GIVE HER AND OUR OTHER OVERSEAS TERRITORIES THEIR OWN MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
20180206-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20180206-22:29:46_6 NEED TO LOOK FURTHER WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE MAJOR LARGGALE POLITICAL QUESTION AS WELL
20140312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20140312-16:57:27_8 OF COURSE I DO UNDERSTAND THE HARDSHIPS FOR MANY EUROPEANS IN THIS CRISIS
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:41:41_5 NUMBER TWO THE QUESTION CANNOT BE EXTERNALIZED AND THE ANSWER CANNOT BE SIMPLY REPRESSIVE
20120703-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120703-20:30:20_2 I DO THINK THAT IT IS ACTUALLY A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO HAVE A BASIC BANKING ACCOUNT
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_3 THE QUESTION IS SIMPLE HOW DO WE WANT TO DEAL WITH THOSE CHALLENGES
20170913-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170913-15:26:10_7 HOW SHALL THE COMMISSION MAKE SURE THAT ALL CONSUMERS IN EUROPE HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_9 SECOND THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY WHICH REMAINED FRAGILE
20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_5 WE SEE A SITUATION NOW WHERE TO PURCHASE ABOUT HALF OF WHAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO REACH OUR THARKET
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-11:31:44_3 THE FUTURE OF POLAND AND EUROPE STATE CAPTURE BY A SINGLE PARTY THAT IS NOT THE FUTURE
20150909-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20150909-21:06:29_8 IN TOO MANY PLACES IN EUROPE THE LABOR MARKET IS RIGID EVEN STATIC
20170704-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170704-10:49:44_8 WE ALL KNOW THAT SOME MEMBER STATES WILL DO THEIR BEST TO WEAKEN THIS LEGISLATION
20170614-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20170614-19:03:45_2 WE SHOULD HAVE A BETTER GUARANTEE AND HAVE A BETTER LOOK ON THE ADDITIONALITY
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_28 I FULLY SHARED THE PARLIAMENT'S SENSE OF URGENCY TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS PROPOSAL
20090204-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20090204-17:04:59_8 THESE ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER STANDARD RESTRICTIONS MAKE CARS MORE EXPENSIVE
20151014-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20151014-17:52:50_2 AND THIS IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL HAVE TO SHARE THOSE COASTS
20180614-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180614-10:46:02_8 HE SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY RELEASED ON HUMANITARIAN GROWS
20180614-0900-PLENARY-en_20180614-12:20:00_2 CAPATACH CORSE PROBLEMS INSIGHTE MEMBER STATES IN NATIONAL TRANSPORT
20170404-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170404-10:00:04_1 NEEDS STRONGER RULES THAT WILL EFFECTIVELY DEAL WITH THE ORMISSION PROBLEMS FOR DESAL CARS
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_32 THAT WILL REQUIRE US TO SHAKE GLOBAL INSTITUTIONS AND MY MESSAGE TO THIS PARLIAMENT IS VERY CLEAR
20131007-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131007-20:14:10_2 THIS IS A RISING BUT UNDER REPORTED PROBLEM IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES
20160913-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20160913-13:58:14_2 WE HAVE TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY AND PROPER MANAGEMENT OF FUNDS
20180614-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20180614-12:20:00_2 CAPATASHE COURSE PROBLEMS INSIHDE MEMBER STATES IN NATIONAL TRANSPORT
20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_11 SO I THINK THIS REPORT IS IMPORTANT
20171115-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20171115-15:54:16_6 IN TWO YEARS ONE HUNDRED CONCENTRATION CAMPS WERN PLACED
20180614-0900-PLENARY-en_20180614-12:20:00_3 NOW WE ARE LIMITING IT TO TWO DAYS PER MEMBER STATE AND IT WILL BE PASSING FROM DAY ONE
20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_4 BY DEVELOPING IT INTO A SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT CALMSING
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_10 LET ME RECALL THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF THESE AUTONOMOUS TRAIT PREFERENCES
20181212-0900-PLENARY-en_20181212-13:38:30_1 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAD AN AMBITIOUS PROPOSAL BY THAT COMMISSION
20171213-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171213-18:39:23_2 AND THEREFORE REACHING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS WITHIN THE IU IS VITAL
20090324-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090324-11:06:53_2 AND THAT IN TURN I THINK OFFERS US AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM OUR PAST MISTAKES
20090309-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090309-20:05:45_2 MUST DO ALL WE POSSIBLY CAN AT THE MOMENT TO SUPPORT THESE COMPANIES IN DIFFICULT TIMES
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_9 BRINGS DANGERS THAT WE CANNOT IGNORE ANY MORE
20170213-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170213-20:41:06_12 LET ME REMIND YOU THAT TIME HELPS MONOPOLIES AND DAMAGES ESSENIS
20180530-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20180530-16:50:04_1 IT SHOULD AT LEAST MAKE SURE THAT THE GATES ARE NOT CLOSED TO PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT HAVING BADGES HA
20170704-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170704-22:07:26_5 WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESSURE HUMAN GOVERNMENT MORE TO OPEN UP
20180118-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20180118-15:31:41_2 IT IS ABOUT EUROPEAN CITIZENS THRUST INTO EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND INSTITUTIONS
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_16 HAVING SAID THAT REFORM DOES NOT MEAN A WHOLEREDESIGN OF EUROPE
20141021-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20141021-18:44:22_9 THIS ALL CREATES A NIGHTMARE FOR THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS
20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_5 THE EUROPEAN UNION DESPITE WHAT IT LIKES TO THINK IS NOT A NATION
20171026-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171026-09:32:35_0 MISTER PRESIDENT ALL MEMBERS OF STATES HAVE VERY DISTINCT LEGAL CULTURES
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_28 OFTEN THEY OFFER PRODUCTS IN A DIVERSE MULTI PARTY CONJUNCTION
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_6 FURTHER DEMAND NEEDS TO BE TACKLED AS IT CAN BE CONSIDERED A ROOD COURSE
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-21:23:51_2 HOWEVER THE ETERNALLY CRUCIAL ISSUE REMAINS THAT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-21:23:51_2 HOWEVER THE ETERNALLY CRUCIL ISSUE REMAINS THAT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_21 THE VALUE OF LAW MAKING IS THE REAL CHIA CHANGE ITS EFFECTS
20180614-0900-PLENARY-en_20180614-10:46:02_8 HE SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY RELEASED ON HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS
20170313-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170313-22:44:10_3 A VISION FOR THE FUTURE MUST NOT FORMALIZE THE PRESENT DAY FRUSTRATIONS
20130418-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20130418-11:45:08_3 THE MONEY COLLECTED WILL GO BACK TO THE SECTOR IF THEY FOLLOW THE LAW
20180418-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180418-21:09:22_23 WOULD YOU HAVE UP DATES TO GIVE US TO DAY ON THE SHOPPING ANTITRUST CASE
20160914-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20160914-16:50:08_6 THEY CREATE MANY JOBS IN EUROPE AND MAKE IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS THAT'S TRUE
20090204-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090204-09:07:32_14 ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS OF ANY COMPREHENSIVE GLOBAL AGREEMENT
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_11 THE PINTAC REVOLUTION THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING IS GLOBAL
20170613-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170613-15:26:44_1 IMPLEMENTATION AND INFORMENT ARE FUNDAMENTAL FOR OUR FUTURE
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_6 EXPRESSED SATISFACTION WHEN THE ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT WAS RATIFIED
20171114-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171114-09:21:49_12 AND THIS IS THE MOMENT WHERE I HAVE TO TURN TO FINANCE MINISTERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE POWER
20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_1 IN ORDER FIRST TO STAY BELOW A TWO DEGREE INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE
20180418-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20180418-13:33:54_5 THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THEY SHOULD SPEAK UP MUCH MORE LOUDLY
20120911-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20120911-17:07:34_2 FOUR THOUSAND DAYS AND NIGHTS NEARLY ELEVEN YEARS
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_4 BREGZET IS AN UNFORTUNATE REALITY BUT WE HAVE TO MOVE ON
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:27:34_3 DEBATES HOWEVER SEEM TO BE CONCENTRATING ON WHOEVER GETS THE TICKET IN THE WHITE HOUSE
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_36 PLEASE DO NOT SWITCH OUT THIS LIGHT VOTE FOR SETA
20140312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20140312-21:46:07_4 DEVELOPS INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS
20171130-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20171130-11:58:41_2 AND WE HAVE TO ADD NOW WHAT HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY REOPENED
20090310-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090310-13:44:27_9 IT COULD BY ITSELF BE THE BIGGEST HELPFUL BUSINESSES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_31 WE SHOULD SEIZE SUCH OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF PAYMENTS APPROPRIATIONS INTOE
20141022-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20141022-17:30:24_8 I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN POLITICS IN REALLY YOUNG AR AGE AT SIXTEEN YEARS OLD
20130522-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20130522-19:21:16_3 THE WHOLE POLITICAL PROCESS WAS DISRUPTED DUE TO PARLIAMENTARY BLOCKING FOR MANY WEEKS
20090204-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090204-18:07:41_3 I DO AM WELCOME THE IDEA OF A LEAD STACE AND WHICH WAS ANNOUNCED RECENTLY A
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-19:52:40_12 IS AN OBLIGATION FOR BILATERAL INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILIRY MEMBER STATE
20180612-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180612-19:52:40_12 AS AN OBLIGATION FOR BI LATERAL INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY MEMBER STATE
20170911-0900-PLENARY-23-en_20170911-22:21:23_1 WHICH IS VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH THE COMMISSIONER'S OWN POLICY AND HA STRATEGY
20180205-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180205-20:59:23_5 WE NEED TO DO OUR BEST TO BREAK DOWN NATIONAL SILOS
20130205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20130205-09:52:51_1 HOWEVER MADAME COMMISSIONER THERE WAS A KEY MESORE MISSING FROM YOUR PROPOSAL
20130206-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130206-19:55:00_13 WHY IS IT THAT ONE COUNTRY CAN BLOCK PROGRESS FOR A UROPEAN UNION
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-08:34:44_5 SEE I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST BENEFIT WE CAN ALREADY SEE FROM THIS AGREEMENT
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-10:55:22_7 BUT THEY WERE MEN AND WOMEN OF THEIR TIME AS IT IS A TREATY OF ITS TIME
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_12 GREEK GOVERNMENT IS DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO HELP AND MEMBER STATES ARE SUPPORTING IT
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_8 A PART OF THE ER WAY IT DEALT WITH IT BEFORE WAS N GO'S DOING THE FOOD SUPPL
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_11 CITIZENS CANNOT GO ON BEING DISILLUSIONED ONE SUMMIT AFTER ANOTHER
20180416-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180416-21:37:08_2 APPRECIATED AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE COME UP WITH A A GOOD REPORT
20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_6 WE CAN SEE IT'S NEITHER EFFICIENT NOR LEGAL
20131008-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20131008-11:22:06_3 THE COMMISSOL PROPOSAL IS REINFORCING THIS DIRECTIVE
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_10 MORE THAN A CHILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN SPENT IN RECAPITALIZING BANKS ACROSS THE WORLD
20180312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180312-21:47:46_1 I THINK THE BIGGEST THING IS THAT WE ARE ABING THINGS TO HAPPEN
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-16:22:27_4 THAT THE IPIPI GROUP HAS APPROVED ITS OWN STRATEGY
20170406-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170406-09:41:23_5 DAY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE TEIR PROSPERITY TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF EUROPE
20170316-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170316-09:26:23_7 WE DECIDE WHAT IS MONITORED AND WHEN AND HOW AND IF
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_10 WE MUST FACE UP TO THE REALITY THAT THE EUROPEAN'S HORIZONS HASE SHIFTED
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-22:17:13_12 A EUROPE CAN SURVIVE IN GLOBAL ECONOMY ONLY AS A COMPETITIVE ECONOMY
20180910-0900-PLENARY-en_20180910-19:34:04_10 AND THIS IS  TOGETHER WITH SOME NEGOTIATION OF THE MYFET
20150430-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150430-09:30:09_2 THAT POINT WHICH MOTIVATES MANY OF THE REQUESTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE OF THE BANK
20090325-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090325-10:58:27_2 AND THIS WILL REQUIRE PRO ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS BY MEMBER STATE GOVERNMENTS
20180207-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180207-19:52:58_8 TOO MANY MANDATES AT THE SAME TIME CAN LEAD TO FRAGMENTATION AND TO HIGH COST
20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_11 THEY ARE READY TO GIVE THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO TRAFFICKERS BECAUSE THERE IS NOT GOOD GOVERNORCE TE
20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_10 MANY MIGRANTS ARE NOT EVEN EXTREMELY POOR BUT THEY ARE ALL EXTREMELY DESPERATE
20150210-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150210-12:38:08_9 I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE COMMISSIONER A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION
20150909-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20150909-21:06:29_4 IT IS UNFORTUNATE FOR THE BUSINESSES WHICH CANNOT FILL THEIR VACANCIES
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_21 NAIVE BUT WE WANT TO ASK THE WORLD TO WORK TOGETHER WITH US
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-11:36:19_3 IF THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE CALLING FOR DAN WILL COME BACK IN EUROPE
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_17 AND WHATEVER THE VIEWS IN THIS PARLIAMENT I THINK PEOPLE HAVE GOT A FACE UP TO THAT AS WELL THE 
20160606-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160606-20:35:47_3 STANDARD SETTERS ACADEMICS AND EXPERTS
20180205-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180205-20:59:23_3 I ASK FOR YOUR BROAD SUPPORT IN THE VOTE TO MORROW
20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-16:49:49_5 THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION MUST TAKE INITIATIVE ACTION AND NOW
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_14 LIKE IT OR LIKE IT NOT THE WORLD IS CHANGING INCREDIBLY AT FAST
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_17 THE FINANCIAL BENEFITS ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT TWO BILLION YEAR
20170214-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20170214-23:13:56_1 WAS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT BROUGHT US TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_20 THIS COULD PAVE THE WAY FOR THE EVENTUAL EROSION OF THE UNITY
20170118-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170118-15:42:09_0 YER HEARE LET MISTER PRESIDENT FACE ALLOW ME TO
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_9 THE FIRST REVISION OF THE IMAS SCHEME WAS NOT ENCOURAGING
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_32 WORLD IS WATCHING EUROPEAN UNION WHICH DIRECTION WE WILL TAKE
20130415-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130415-17:35:01_1 I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO USE OTHER INSTRUMENTS LIKE REGULATION FOR INSTANCE
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_15 MORE MANUFACTURING IS BEING DONE IN ASIA THAN IN EUROPE
20131209-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131209-19:07:30_9 IF THIS COMPROMISE IS FURTHER WATERED DOWN IT WILL BECOME MEANINGLESS
20180418-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20180418-13:38:40_5 WE THE MAJORITY OF EUROPE DO NOT WANT MIGRATION
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:54:28_8 WE NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR IN THIS REGARD
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-22:25:56_2 IT IS ABOUT BASIC AND FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND IT IS ABOUT JOBS
20170518-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20170518-11:03:16_1 RECEIVED ALMOST ONE MILLION OF REFUGEES FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES
20171025-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171025-09:28:48_11 THIS SYSTEM YOU DON'T GET TRACK OF ANY VIZA OVER STAYER IN THE EUROPENAN ONO
20180315-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180315-15:04:13_3 WE TALK IN THIS HOUSE ABOUT PERFORMANCE BASE BURCHETTING
20131008-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20131008-11:22:06_5 FURTHERMORE WE ASK MORE SOSOR A CIVIL PARTICIPATION
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:54:28_8 WE NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR IN THIS REGARD
20101124-0900-PLENARY-26-en_20101124-12:25:01_5 WE ALSO EXPECT CHINA TO CLEARLY CONDEMN THIS ACT
20090204-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20090204-17:04:59_9 HELPING TO KILL OFF AN INDUSTRY WHICH IS ALREADY A SERIOUS BOTHER
20171025-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171025-09:28:48_2 WE HAVE TO CHECK THE PASSPORTS AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING
20180206-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20180206-22:29:46_5 HOWEVER THIS PROUD PLACE COMES WITH RESPONSIBILITIES
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_3 THIS OUTCOME MUST BE SEEN IN THE BIGGER POLITICAL CONTEXT
20090204-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20090204-17:04:59_6 AT COAL MANUFACTURE IS A BREAK FROM ENVIRONMENTAL RESTRICTIONS
20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_5 FURTHERMORE WE NEED A COMPLETELY NEW APPROACH TO FINANCING DEVELOPMENT
20090310-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090310-09:24:48_3 NOW THAT IS THE CONTEXT IN WHICH WE ARE DISCUSSING THIS REPORT
20141124-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141124-19:43:56_1 BUT THE PROGRAMMING STAGE IS STILL FAR FROM BEING FINALIZED
20150210-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150210-12:38:08_7 WE HAVE DONE STUDIES AND WE HAVE COLLECTED INFORMATION DATA AND KNOWLEDGE
20180315-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180315-15:04:13_13 SO WE WANT TO HEAR CLEARLY WHAT THE COMMISSION IS WILLING
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-11:29:19_7 YOU ERE SAID WE SHOULD LISTEN TO CITIZENS AND THEIR CONCERNS
20180530-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20180530-16:50:04_11 IS NO PASSPORT AND NO CITIZENSHIP BY INVESTMENT
20170705-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20170705-09:40:38_4 WHAT ISE THE ORDER SO TO SAY IN THIS RESPECT
20160705-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20160705-18:52:45_8 THIS SITUATION WILL BE IMPROVED BY THE NEW REGULATIONS
20180530-0900-PLENARY-29-en_20180530-22:03:01_6 AN TO MAKE SURE WE MAKE IT MORE OPEN AND INCLUSIVE LESS FORMAL AND RIGID
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_3 AND YES I WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE THAT WE NEED EUROPEAN APPROACH
20170704-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20170704-19:05:24_4 THIS IS THE KEY POINT WHENE WE TALK ABOUT COHESION
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_14 WE IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY WE WANT TO HAVE A QUANTUM COMPUTER
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_23 WE MUST RESPECT THE SCOPE OF EACH DIGITAL FILE
20170314-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20170314-19:35:02_8 AS I SAID THERE IS NO OR NO ROOM FOR COMPLACENCY AND MANY THINGS HAVE TO BE DONE
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_4 I THOUGHT THE WORLD HAD SEEN ENOUGH OF CLEVER FINANCIAL TRICKS
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:43:11_27 WE ALSO HAVE TO REMAIN FOCUSED AND THIS IS CRUCIAL ON STRUCTURAL REFORMS
20180312-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180312-22:11:27_3 I VERY MUCH WELCOME THE MAIN FINDING OF THESE REPORTS
20130312-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20130312-21:52:39_6 WITH RESPECT TO THE EQUAL PAY FOR THE SAME JOB
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_11 HOW WILL THE COMMISSION COUNTER THIS STRANGT IN ITS NEW STRATEGY
20180116-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180116-10:45:18_6 INDEED EDUCATION AND CULTURE HAVE TO DO WITH CIVILIZATION
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_2 IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RELIGION BUT IT HAS ALL TO DO WITH PATRIARCHY
20180207-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180207-19:52:58_7 TOO NARROW FOCUS WE MEAN THAT WE WILL BE MISSING SOME TARGETS
20170118-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170118-15:42:09_14 UNITED KINGDOM THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WHALES
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-08:34:44_12 OF COURSE OTHER MEMBER SATES HAVE TO DO A LOT AS WELL WED
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_25 IT WILL DELIVER ADDITIONAL  POSSIBILITIES FOR SERVICES
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:32:20_11 THERE ARE NOT FIRST CLASS AND SECOND CLASS COUNTRIES
20170404-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170404-09:52:16_7 BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE SOME DISAPPOINTING INFORMATIONS
20171003-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20171003-18:00:00_4 AND IT IS ALSO A QUESTION OF WHEN THE AUTHORITIES DO THIS KIND OF VIOLENCE
20150325-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20150325-16:04:24_3 AND ONE OF HIS SPOKESMEN SENT YOU A TWEAT BLAMING THE MEMBER STATES
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:43:11_1 THANK YOU ALL FOR PARTICIPATING IN THIS DEBATE
20171213-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171213-18:39:23_1 ITS ASENIQUANON FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR PLANET AND FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR PEOPLE
20090324-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20090324-17:45:27_1 AND IS IT FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO REFLECT CHANGING TIMES
20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_2 NOW IF WE DON'T STAY BELOW TWO DEGREES WE KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN
20140312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20140312-16:57:27_5 POLITICS IS ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY
20170705-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20170705-09:40:38_6 THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
20171213-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171213-18:39:23_12 YOUR PORTFOLIO NO POVERTY REDUCING INEQUALITY DECENT WORK
20111213-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20111213-22:38:55_5 SO THAT WAS MY QUESTION IF IT'S REALLY APPROPRIATE AND IT IF ITW WERE
20090204-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20090204-17:04:59_1 IT'S GOT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT'S IN THE DRIVING SEAT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
20131209-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131209-19:07:30_5 IN EXCHANGE WE GOT THE PROTECTION OF THE VULNERABLE MARINE CONSISTENCE
20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-15:50:02_10 AND NO RIFLES OR SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORLD CAN DO THAT
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-23:10:55_3 THIS HOUSE WILL AGREE ON A RESOLUTION
20171213-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171213-18:39:23_9 AND YOU COULD SAY WELL IN TIMES OF FAKE NEWS IT'S GOOD TO HAVE DARTA
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-15:10:37_9 BUT EUROPE IS ALSO ABOUT FREEDOM TRANSPARENCY AND TRUTH
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_27 FINTAC ACTORS ARE ALREADY BREAKING SYLOS THEMSELVES
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_21 HOWEVER IT DOES INTEND TO POSE THE RIGHT QUESTIONS
20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_13 THIS IS WHY WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO HELP THEM FINANCIALLY
20180614-0900-PLENARY-en_20180614-12:26:45_1 IT HAS TO DO WITH A VERY IMPORTANT ARGUMENT ON DEMOCRACY
20160606-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160606-20:35:47_4 LET ME FOCUS ON THE MAIN POINTS OF THIS REPORT
20180614-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20180614-12:26:45_1 IT HAS TO DO WITH A VERY IMPORTANT ARGUMENT OF DEMOCRACY

20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_31 THAT THERE ARE GLOBAL PROBLEMS THAT NEED GLOBAL SOLUTIONS
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_5 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SITUATION IN GREECE IT'S DIFFICULT
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_20 THE REPORT DOES NOT INTEND TO GIVE TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS
20171026-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171026-10:54:34_10 SO IF YOU PROPOSE THIS FUND WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT
20171025-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171025-15:58:29_2 IT IS BEYOND ALL DIGNITY AND SENSE
20180702-0900-PLENARY-en_20180702-19:18:18_4 AND WE NEEDTER UNDERSTAND AND BE AWARE OF THAT

20171213-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171213-18:39:23_6 IT SAYS THAT WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS WEARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
20180702-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20180702-19:18:18_4 AND WE NEEDTER UNDERSTAND AND BE AWARE OF THAT
20171026-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171026-09:32:35_2 A BLANKET POLICY CANNOT WORK IN THIS UNION
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-11:24:15_4 ANVELSAY HAPPY THAT YOU MATE AT BOINT AND WE HAVE TO WORK ON THAT
20090507-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20090507-12:04:26_6 I THINK IT TELLS YOU ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE UQE INDEPENDENCE PARTY
20090507-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090507-12:04:26_6 I THINK IT TELLS YOU ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE UKA INDEPENDENCE PARTY
20150325-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150325-20:56:20_1 THE MINIMUM WEIGHT IN ITSELF IS NOT THE PROBLEM
20171025-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171025-15:58:29_3 SMUGGLERS EXIST BECAUSE THERE IS A LACK OF LEGAL PATHWAYS
20180206-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180206-11:12:41_8 TIME THAT THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DO ITS PART OF THE JOB
