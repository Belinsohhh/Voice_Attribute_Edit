20180530-0900-PLENARY-26-en_20180530-20:01:52_0 Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank all the Members who have participated in this important debate for their different contributions.
20170613-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170613-10:11:09_17 there. I look forward to continuing to work with you on the effort sharing proposal and bringing it to a successful conclusion with your support.
20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_2 We all agreed at the last session in Strasbourg that development is important, but we need to remember it now when we are talking about the financial contributions.
20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_8 We need to invest in enablers of development and yes, most of all, we need to invest in good governance.
20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_11 They are ready to give thousands of euros to traffickers because there is not good governance.
20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_10 Many migrants are not even extremely poor, but they are all extremely desperate.
20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_9 If we get back, for example, to the issue of migration we will see that this is the key question the question of governance.
20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_1 Poverty, war and also the lack of freedom and bad governance is what makes desperate people undertake dangerous journeys in the search for a better life in Europe, and development cooperation is an important part of the answer to this challenge.
20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_7 In all these efforts ahead of the 13th National Conference in Addis Ababa, we need to be aware of the fact that finance alone will not be sufficient. Policies are of fundamental importance in achieving sustainable development goals. We need policies that will ensure that financial resources are used effectively and in areas that will bring further mobilisation of resources and sustainable development.
20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_5 Furthermore, we need a completely new approach to financing development.
20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:06:22_13 This is the first regulatory act which will provide police in all Member States with their common rules.
20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-16:26:52_1 I suppose and I am sure that it is not the end of the discussion or even the beginning of the discussion because it is a very complicated package, and I do not think that all of our Members have read the full package.
20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-16:26:52_10 We have to be ready for that.
20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-16:26:52_11 This does not mean that we have to be technologically ahead of technology. We have to be very firm on our principal ground it is the fundamental right of people to be people people first, with technology for people.
20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-16:26:52_8 Nanotechnology is ahead of us.
20170214-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20170214-23:13:56_1 was one of the reasons that brought us to the financial crisis.
20090204-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20090204-18:30:04_3 Could we not do more, and could you perhaps be more specific about what has been done so far? What are your aims?
20110117-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20110117-22:45:45_0 Mr President, I also want to raise the issue of respect for religious freedom for all, without discrimination, because this is a basic human right.
20171212-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20171212-11:43:32_9 nan
20170704-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170704-10:49:44_8 We all know that some Member States will do their best to weaken this legislation.
20170704-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170704-11:31:41_10 We took many measures to improve the situation and I believe we achieved certain improvements.
20171129-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171129-18:52:34_5 With climate change bringing more extreme weather events, we need to be able to protect human lives and valuable assets and to make our regions, our cities and our towns more resilient.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20141021-17:48:50_3 As for energy, three years ago the EU Heads of Government decided to set the current year, 2014, as a clear deadline for the completion of an internal energy market.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20141021-17:48:50_5 Well, all is on track. The Commission action plans have been published and updated.
20171002-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171002-19:45:50_2 Parliament also says clearly that it urges the Member States which are absent here not to impose any obligation on encryption providers that would result in the weakening or compromising of the security of their networks or services, such as the creation or facilitation of back doors'.
20120201-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20120201-20:10:03_1 For the EU, the immediate challenge is to help ensure a fair and inclusive electoral process and to be prepared for a range of scenarios.
20120201-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20120201-20:10:03_2 But we should not lose sight of the big picture.
20090323-0900-PLENARY-8-en_20090323-17:13:31_1 The Irish system works within a legal and regulatory policy directive framework dictated by the EU.
20090323-0900-PLENARY-8-en_20090323-17:13:31_4 Ireland is no worse, or better, than any other place. I object to hostile comments about Ireland emanating from London, New York and the German media.
20090323-0900-PLENARY-8-en_20090323-17:13:31_5 All these places have experienced regulatory and banking challenges and problems equal to and, in many cases, far worse than those we have faced in Ireland.
20090323-0900-PLENARY-8-en_20090323-17:13:31_6 The constant sniping from some of our EU neighbours has been based on prejudice rather than objective fact and does little for EU solidarity at a time when Europe is going through enormous financial and economic challenges.
20140114-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20140114-19:05:37_0 Thank you very much for the question.
20120611-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20120611-20:08:06_2 Raising funds for research and care, addressing discrimination at work and advocating policy change by decision makers all depend on prior awareness and understanding of multiple sclerosis.
20131209-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131209-19:07:30_10 Our choice tomorrow is to go for a strong mandate with a ban and go for negotiations, or go for negotiations using our mandate as a starting point and end up with something meaningless.
20131209-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131209-19:07:30_5 In exchange we got the protection of the vulnerable marine ecosystems.
20131209-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131209-19:07:30_7 And yet, one month after we adopted our compromise, the Council did not put it on the agenda, did not even present it. I used this time to talk to the Member States and the presidencies.
20131209-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131209-19:07:30_9 If this compromise is further watered down it will become meaningless.
20180228-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180228-17:14:28_3 If you want to change the rules in Parliament on the balance of the countries, you have to change it first in the Council and then we will see. Finally, I fully understand the position of the Council in the Spitzenkandidaten issue, but they also have to understand ours, because we have to approve
20180228-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180228-17:14:28_4 the candidate, we have to approve their programme, and we have to approve the College.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180418-21:09:22_25 cases. Finally, you were in the US last week. I hope you had interesting meetings.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180418-21:09:22_23 you. Would you have updates to give us today on the shopping antitrust
20180418-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180418-21:09:22_9 In this report we strongly support the independence of the Commission and the national competition authorities.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180418-21:09:22_3 The first time was with Commissioner Almunia in
20180418-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180418-21:09:22_5 As you know, this is a non—binding report, but it sends a strong political message to the Commission.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180418-21:09:22_4 2013. This may be the last competition report of this term. Next year we will have European elections again.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_22 Yet the importance of our partnership with the EIB and with the European Union in meeting our commitments, both to our shareholders and to our countries of operations, is clearer than ever.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_13 Second, under the aegis of the European Union, new structures of cooperation between EBRD and EIB offer great new opportunities for us to work together.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_15 These initiatives, facilitated by EC funds, bring us together to work concretely on specific projects and programmes combining the strength of each institution and, as such, offer an excellent crucible in which to forge the development of our joint work.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_11 With this wide range of stakeholders we are working together to implement the plan and are developing the coordination and cooperation mechanisms to do so. And we see as we saw last August when faced with the conflict driven banking crisis in Georgia
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_17 Third, I take the European Parliament's views as welcome input to the early stages of the EBRD's fourth capital resources review which we will conclude at our annual meeting in Zagreb in May
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_4 Faced with the dramatic decline in private flows of credit, we came together last month with the World Bank group to launch the joint IFI action plan in support of banking systems and lending to the real economy in central and eastern Europe.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_19 an increase of more than
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_2 First, the context of the financial and economic crisis renders any encouragement of greater cooperation between EBRD and EIB more relevant than ever.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_20 20. At the same time, we have to acknowledge that our risk exposure is also increasing.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_18 2010. The EBRD has taken a proactive stance in response to the crisis supporting our clients in countries of operations, we are expanding our instruments, and aim to invest EUR 7 billion in 2009
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_3 Yet the crisis also means that cooperation between public international financial institutions is no longer just a policy driven aspiration but a vital necessity.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_21 The full implications of the current situation on our portfolio and on the development of our business cannot yet be clearly seen.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_16 I believe it is in this context that we may find divisions of labour, applications of joint expertise and the necessary mechanisms of cooperation, including common standards, which you have called for.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_12 that this kind of IFI cooperation, born of need, is the kind that works best.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_14 I refer in particular to the Western Balkans investment framework, now being launched, as well as to the Eastern Partnership announced by the European Council in recent days which will build on the good cooperation we have already established through our memorandum of understanding and the neighbourhood investment facility.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_7 The action plan recognises that an effective crisis response in Europe's integrated financial markets requires fast and coordinated action by all stakeholders parent banks which own a large part of the region's financial sectors
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_0 Mr President, what worries me most is the suggestion that the European Investment Bank has a significant role to play in solving the financial crisis that it can somehow act as the Europe wide body to provide stimulus where Member States have singularly failed to coordinate their own stimuli.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_4 I thought the world had seen enough of clever financial tricks.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_2 nan
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_3 It would be a serious issue if it were to go bust, like some of our commercial banks. The report even encourages the EIB and the Commission to increase lending by experimenting with new innovative financial instruments.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_1 The danger is that, if it expands its activities too far into supporting commercial banks and governments as has been suggested then its enviable high credit rating may be downgraded, like some of our governments.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_17 However, I would stress that the Commission has neither the capacity nor the desire to lead the delivery of the action plan itself.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_11 The implementation of an action plan will require real cooperation, commitment and leadership from Member States and regional stakeholders to deliver the 80 or so projects included at this stage.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_9 This rapid progress is important if we are to maintain momentum as we enter the implementation phase of the strategy.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_19 This is the only way to ensure that the ownership of a strategy is in the hands of the Member States and other stakeholders.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_26 The Commission very much expects Parliament to be actively involved in events such as the annual forum.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_22 The first formal assessment of progress made will be presented under the Polish Presidency in the second half of
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_24 This will give all stakeholders an opportunity to consider how the first months of the strategy have gone and what lessons might already be drawn at that stage.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_15 The coordination monitoring and reporting is done by the Commission and the implementation on the ground is led by the Member States or organisations of the Baltic Sea Region.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_13 I would now like to say a few words about the planned governance system which is proposed for the operational implementation of the strategy.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_14 This is one area where there has been much discussion among the Member States, but the overall approach is that policy orientations will be taken by the Council.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_4 The Baltic Sea Strategy has required a completely new approach from the European Commission as it is the first time that we have prepared an integrated strategy for a group of Member States who have to face the same challenges and who may benefit from the same opportunities.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_12 In financial terms, although there is no additional financing from the EU budget, the strategy proposes a more coordinated use of existing funds and a more imaginative approach to other funding sources such as the European Investment Bank or the Nordic Investment Bank.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_2 Of course, it is not a complete surprise to me that Parliament is taking such an interest in the strategy.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_23 2011. However, prior to that, the first annual forum of the Baltic Sea Strategy will take place next year.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_25 I would like to conclude by saying that I look forward to continuing to work closely with Parliament on all aspects of strategy.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_8 the Swedish Presidency has led positive and constructive discussions in Council which are to lead to conclusions already in October.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_21 Here we expect to see a wave of coordination meetings to kick start the various priority areas and individual projects included in the action plan.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_18 Responsibility must rest with the relevant Member States and other stakeholders directly involved on the ground.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_27 Your backing is crucial to maintain widespread visibility for the strategy to maintain high level political support for the strategy and to maintain pressure on the Member States and the regional actors to deliver results.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_16 In addition, the Commission proposes to play the role of a facilitator in the case of difficulties.
20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_10 I would like to underline this point as it must be clear that all our preparatory work on the strategic framework that I have just described will count for nought unless we start to deliver genuine visible concrete results on the ground, hence the importance of the strategy's action plan which has also been drawn up during the preparatory work.
20180417-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20180417-15:28:50_1 the population of Europe.
20180417-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20180417-15:28:50_2 The majority are fed up with mass migration. They do not want any more migrants and they want to send back those who are now here.
20180417-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20180417-15:28:50_3 We are on one side and, on the other side, there is the whole corrupt political elite. The thing is that the majority of the citizens of Europe cannot really speak up because they are punished, they are oppressed, there are all these hate speech laws that silence people. It is really strange that we are the
20180417-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20180417-15:28:50_5 We do have freedom of speech and we speak up for the majority of the citizens of Europe, but they should also speak up and they should support Hungary in our efforts.
20090423-0900-PLENARY-25-en_20090423-21:41:42_0 Mr President, could I say that the Commissioner showed a good understanding of the construction industry.
20090423-0900-PLENARY-25-en_20090423-21:41:42_6 I would emphasise the need for more CE marking, which is absolutely essential. We do not want to see any more national standards and I wish this whole process every success for the future.
20090423-0900-PLENARY-25-en_20090423-21:41:42_1 All I would say is that I think it represents a larger percentage of overall GDP, something like 12 or 13, and of materials, say, 4 or 5, so it is a very important sector. I am a civil engineer by background and it was a privilege to do the opinion on behalf of the
20090423-0900-PLENARY-25-en_20090423-21:41:42_7 It is a very important measure in a very important industry.
20090423-0900-PLENARY-25-en_20090423-21:41:42_5 The construction industry does need a regulation after 20 years of having the Directive in place.
20130311-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130311-18:14:05_1 It is evident that gender equality must be mainstreamed in all policy responses to the crisis, in all education and training policies in the European Social Fund and in other programmes, so as to enable greater social integration through employment.
20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_12 I have in mind a council with a wider mandate covering all economic, social, environmental and human development in the world.
20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_14 Now we should do the same in the European Union.
20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_18 I think that we should pay a lot of attention to development issues also in that report.
20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_2 For me personally, the most important achievements in this report are the recommendations on the substantial strengthening of the economic, social, environmental and developmental dimensions of the UN system.
20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_4 by developing it into a Sustainable Development Council.
20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_0 Mr President, my report includes several proposals for strengthening the role of the United Nations system in global governance and for improving the possibilities of the European Union and its Member States to better achieve our foreign policy goals inside the system.
20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_8 These ideas got a lot of support in the negotiations, but not enough in order to be accepted.
20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_7 I proposed that the Council would have permanent members the European Union, the USA, Japan and the BRICS countries and rotating ones.
20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_3 According to the report, this must be done in the first instance by means of structural and functional reform of the Economic and Social Council, but we also call on the EU institutions and Member States to consider the possibility of strengthening their role in the ECOSOC
20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_11 Chancellor Angela Merkel proposed, in a speech to the World Economic Council in Davos in 2009, the creation of a UN Economic Council according to the model of the UN Security Council.
20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_15 In the negotiations on my EU—UN report, I felt that those who emphasise the importance of the security dimension of the United Nations were reluctant to strengthen the other parts of the UN system.
20180502-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180502-15:01:39_3 We do appreciate the own resources, although we would have wanted to have more ambitious own resources.
20180502-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180502-15:01:39_5 We've made an agreement in the framework of the United Nations and it's called SDGs, and in your introduction, Mr Commissioner, neither you or Juncker mentioned the STGs, and I think it's so extremely important that we use this budget to make sure that all the money that we spend in all these sectors is used to come up with good results on the sustainable development goals.
20180614-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180614-10:46:02_5 Oleg Sentsov's case is no longer just a judicial or political one.

20170315-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170315-16:48:33_1 The vicious circle has now been broken.

20170315-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170315-17:37:31_1 Now we just have to implement this regulation.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170315-17:37:31_4 We believe that legal trade is good and that trade is meant to sustain jobs and prosperity for people and for communities.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170315-17:37:31_7 There is one thing that I believe we can do immediately, distinguished colleagues, tomorrow we can show the determination of the European Parliament to ensure a clean and sustainable mineral supply chain.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170315-17:37:31_8 We have hammered out an effective and workable regulation now let us show everybody that we are determined to make this first step.

20180315-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180315-15:04:13_17 Next year, we go to the citizens.
20180315-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180315-15:04:13_13 So we want to hear clearly what the Commission is willing to do.
20180315-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180315-15:04:13_3 We talk in this House about performance based budgeting
20180315-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180315-15:04:13_22 nan
20180315-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180315-15:04:13_29 So this is the question the REGI Committee wants to bring forward and I hope that you can come with at least a clear message because it was so silent, it was too silent.
20180315-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180315-15:04:13_16 Second, depending on the outcome of any such anticipated performance review, is the Commission willing to release the performance reserves earlier?
20180315-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180315-15:04:13_18 We have our elections. We did our negotiating in the year 2013 in 2014 we started
20180315-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180315-15:04:13_21 2016... and now we have to wait until 2019 to have an evaluation, and then this money that's already in the envelope of the Member States can be committed to be spent later
20180315-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180315-15:13:57_9 So we have to speak.
20130612-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20130612-21:26:58_1 In this context, I support the idea of drawing Latin America and Africa more deeply into the existing transatlantic dialogue. It is sometimes said that the EU faces the choice between tightening our strategic partnership with the US or working towards more flexible coalitions with other players such as South Africa or Brazil,
20130612-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20130612-21:26:58_2 but it is a false choice.
20180206-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180206-11:12:41_8 It is about time that the European Council did its part of the job.
20180206-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180206-11:12:41_1 nan
20180206-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180206-11:12:41_3 Many of us here are convinced that Europe, the European Union, has been in a protracted crisis, dragging its feet and hounded by nationalists, populists and europhobes. And do you know what?
20180206-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180206-11:12:41_5 It is about a lack of vision to face, in a European fashion, the eurozone needs, globalisation and, most notably, the refugee crisis.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-23:04:14_6 is completely different.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-21:57:09_22 2014 Will the experience of 2014 be repeated?
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-21:57:09_7 This renewed policy definitively leads to more local and European added value.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-21:57:09_20 and clarifying the effects of the late start for the next years N3 will lead to performance payments in the years until
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-21:57:09_9 The ex ante conditionalities we have formulated lead to a more integrated policy and a better structured and targeted result.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-21:57:09_11 It was something new in this House.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-21:57:09_17 We need a new payment plan until
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-21:57:09_8 We see commitments in the social field, especially for younger people to bring them to a job.

20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-21:57:09_23 Member States were still working to finalise the programmes and came with very late agreed programmes for the new period.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-21:57:09_12 The practical reflection and the relation with the European Semester is established. Cohesion concerns three fourths of the country specific recommendations, and we made a performance framework as an example, as I said, of this
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-23:10:55_3 Tomorrow this House will agree on a resolution.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-23:10:55_4 In the resolution is a clear request, without any doubt, and you could also hear it today, that you want to have a master plan on acceleration. And this is not a theoretical thing.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20170215-23:10:55_7 And this means that you look and tell us honestly what does it mean if you start three years later?
20130612-0900-PLENARY-8-en_20130612-13:27:28_0 Mr President, this is just to say that I thought my name would be among the signatures on this resolution.
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_22 2016. The Council protects and supports the budget for instruments that spur growth and thereby create jobs, namely such instruments as EFSI, COSME, Erasmus and others.

20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_13 2016. The Council has accepted in full all appropriations destined for the programmes and agencies dealing with the crisis, including the use of the flexibility instrument for an amount of EUR 530 million and the contingency margin for an amount of EUR

20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_4 This means that we wish to finance adequately investments to spur growth and jobs, for example through the European Fund for Strategic Investments, and to provide sufficient funding to tackle the still ongoing migration crisis and the related external policies.
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_20 So you can see that the Council stands fully behind the European Agenda on Migration, as was agreed between us in
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_19 2016. Programmes and instruments related to the migration crisis and the facility for refugees in Turkey were not affected by reductions.
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_26 2007—2013,
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_16 Global Europe, the Council undertook a thorough analysis in order to identify space for creating the necessary margin since the Commission's proposal for 2017 has completely exhausted the margin for commitments.
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_3 I would like to begin by stating clearly that the main thrust of the Council's position is the prioritisation of expenditure.

20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_23 Subheading 1A, however, has also contributed to the general savings effort concerning some budget lines where the Council considers, following a detailed technical analysis, that the Commission has overestimated the real needs.
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-22:17:13_1 I think the discussion showed that we may have some different views but in general we are united by the fact that we want to have a workable budget, a good budget for European citizens.
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-22:17:13_24 for 2017, and we want to keep the main focus of these discussions on the 2017 budget.
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-22:17:13_12 Europe can survive in the global economy only as a competitive economy.
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-22:17:13_10 If I may, just very briefly, address some of the important points which were made during the discussion.
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-22:17:13_29 I am also looking forward to our cooperation.
20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-22:17:13_2 One of the issues or challenges we have is that we have too many priorities and too little money, and the question is how to use the money in the best possible way.
20110706-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20110706-17:26:49_1 All the people have to feel our assistance.
20110706-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20110706-17:26:49_5 We have to stop all supplies of military equipment to the undemocratic governments in the region.
20110706-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20110706-17:26:49_7 Of course, we have to be very careful not to support the forces and movements with Islamist ideology.
20110706-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20110706-17:26:49_12 We have to have a united Europe in position.
20090915-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090915-19:04:10_17 Last week, on 10 September 2009, the Commission adopted a communication on stepping up international climate finance, which aims at speeding up the international negotiations.
20090915-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090915-19:04:10_15 In this respect, it is worth mentioning the global partnership on technology, which aims at doubling investment in low carbon technologies.
20090915-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090915-19:04:10_3 With 250 pages of negotiating text on the table, the negotiations have not yet gathered sufficient momentum to come to an agreement that is ambitious and detailed enough.
20090915-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090915-19:04:10_4 However, among most parties there is a sense of urgency and the willingness to focus on areas of convergence.
20090915-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090915-19:04:10_14 Money will make or break the deal. We need to mobilise private investment and promote the establishment of a robust international carbon market, but substantial public funding will also be required.
20090915-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090915-19:04:10_16 Furthermore, we have to strengthen support to the poorest and most vulnerable countries to adapt to the increasing adverse effects of climate change.
20090915-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090915-19:04:10_18 There is a daunting task ahead of us, with intense negotiations over the coming months but failure is not an option.
20090915-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090915-19:04:10_6 We need comparable and more ambitious emission reduction targets for the group of developed countries, which in aggregate today offer less than 15 reduction as compared with
20170913-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170913-15:26:10_6 And it is not only that, it is also the other cars that have been cheating and the differences in the different Member States, such as some of them are mandatory, others are voluntary, some are only for the national car market and others are different.
20170913-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170913-15:26:10_8 How will you do that?
20170913-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170913-15:26:10_11 We also have to look to the future and yes, we have to care about our car industry but a new era is coming. It will be electrified, it will be sharing mobility, and if we do not make sure that we do that for our industry, if we do not make sure that we have a zero emissions mandate, then cars will be imported from China and elsewhere in the world and our car industry will have big problems, as will these millions of people.
20170913-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170913-15:26:10_5 Three million cars have not been recalled yet!
20170913-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170913-15:26:10_7 How will the Commission make sure that all consumers in Europe have the same rights?
20150519-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20150519-09:36:10_5 We cannot actually restrict access to the EU market for them, which could be a consequence of such extensive regulation.
20150519-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20150519-09:36:10_6 So excessive regulation could really harm the economies of the developing world and could actually cost jobs there.
20170613-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20170613-22:37:50_7 Ten weeks ago, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement entered into force.
20170613-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20170613-22:37:50_5 One political development is that reducing corruption and organised crime and making the judiciary more efficient has been assessed as good by the Commission.
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_1 A lot has already been said about the magnitude of these rights violations and about the relevance of the topic. Trafficking in human beings needs to be addressed with a human rights based and victim centred approach.
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_2 Victims and vulnerable populations need to be put at the centre of all efforts.
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_3 The prevention of trafficking in human beings and the protection of its victims must be our priority goal.
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_4 Access to justice, support measures, shelter and education needs to be ensured, independent of the victims' willingness to cooperate in criminal proceedings.
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_5 The principle of non criminalisation in this regard is also vital and needs to be implemented in all Member States.
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_6 Further, demand needs to be tackled as it can be considered a root cause.
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_7 Accountability needs to be ensured for both offenders, as well as knowing users.
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_8 For the new strategy, I think that financial investigations and action against money laundering need to play a bigger part in fighting trafficking in human beings and to ensure that confiscated assets are used to support and compensate victims of trafficking.
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_9 Does the Commission agree on this, and how does it intend to address this in the new strategy?
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_10 I am also worried about the trend of trafficking in human beings being mixed up with other legally distinct concepts such as migrant smuggling, increasingly addressing trafficking in human beings through a security lens, for instance in the context of recent migration policies.
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_11 How will the Commission counter this trend in its new strategy?
20170403-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170403-18:59:43_12 I also call for greater internal external coherence in the fight against trafficking in human beings and to further enhance and deepen cooperation and coordination among all relevant actors.
20180206-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180206-18:17:12_4 That would give enlargement a more prominent presence, supplementing the usual progress reports for the countries.
20180206-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180206-18:17:12_2 Therefore, I sincerely welcome the Commission strategy and the action plan as documents which will officially and permanently put Western Balkan enlargement back on the European agenda.
20180206-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180206-18:17:12_1 It also became clear that we simply cannot wait for all major political issues to be settled before we endeavour to have further enlargement.
20180206-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180206-18:17:12_5 All this could provide a strong political backdrop for the difficult work that lies ahead, on all sides, in order to welcome the front—runner countries, Serbia and Montenegro, as full members in
20180206-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180206-18:17:12_3 Additionally, I would call on the Commission to draw up annual reports concerning the implementation of this strategy and the action plan, which should be discussed here in plenary.
20180206-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180206-18:02:41_1 It is important not just for the countries of the region but also for the European Union itself without providing a credible prospect of full membership for all the countries of the Western Balkans the EU global role will not be credible, because this is our region, this is our first commitment.
20180206-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180206-18:02:41_2 We need to invest more, both politically and financially. Yes, it is a difficult process because enlargement is a joint effort.
20180206-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180206-18:02:41_4 But, at the same time, there is always an alternative that we should not forget, and the alternative is embracing nationalism and populism and creating rivalries and hostilities again.
20180206-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180206-18:02:41_5 Where there is a will, there is always a way, and last year the Republic of Macedonia made tremendous progress towards realising that European perspective.
20171003-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20171003-18:00:00_5 Public violence and hate speech against LGBTI people in Egypt are rampant and increasing, and we have reports on that.
20171003-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20171003-18:00:00_7 To say that we are passing on the message, Mr Commissioner, is just not enough you don't pass on the message about human rights you demand that human rights be respected!
20171003-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20171003-18:00:00_8 We need a different kind of partnership.
20171003-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20171003-18:00:00_2 But today I want to raise the specific situation of LGBTI persons being persecuted.
20171003-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20171003-18:00:00_4 It is also a question of when the authorities perpetrate this kind of violence.
20171003-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20171003-17:22:50_13 we are ready for more concrete cooperation in this field, and the Partnership Priorities are giving us the opportunity to explore new forms of common engagement.
20171003-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20171003-17:22:50_1 This was the first Association Council with Egypt in seven years, so the first since the beginning of the revolts in the Arab world.
20150908-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150908-17:53:33_0 Mr President, the ECR Group recognises the practical value of regional development funding and supports efforts to ensure it is spent more efficiently. This sixth report clearly calls for more to be done there. It is not a clean bill of health.
20150908-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150908-17:53:33_1 I and others in the group are not wholly convinced that there is as full an understanding as there should be this funding is not a revenue substitute, nor is it intended to be for more than a third of a century, as has been the case.
20150908-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150908-17:53:33_2 Furthermore, I do not believe that part of the agenda behind the in other respects unobjectionable urban policy is desirable either, especially and I quote to improve the democratic legitimacy of the European project'.
20150908-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150908-17:53:33_3 Best practice and cooperation yes.
20150908-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150908-17:53:33_4 I welcome those elements
20151202-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151202-23:16:01_0 Mr President, control free or check free travel within the frontiers of the Schengen area is a basic principle and one of the greatest achievements of the European Union, although recent tragic events have indeed put Schengen to the test.
20151202-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151202-23:16:01_3 Their travel documents are checked at the official checkpoints, while not all other European citizens have to undergo such monitoring.
20151202-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151202-23:16:01_5 While we must do our best in order to provide security for everyone under current circumstances, such discrimination and unjustified violation of the Schengen Agreement is both unacceptable and unreasonable.
20121022-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20121022-18:49:22_11 This is exactly the aim of the European Year of Citizens 2013 to mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of Union citizenship by the Treaty of Maastricht and to give a new momentum to the debate on Union citizenship.
20121022-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20121022-18:49:22_20 As Members of the European Parliament the only directly elected EU institution we have a crucial role to play in promoting the aims of the European Year of Citizens 2013 by bridging the gap between Brussels and Member States, communicating the rights and benefits of EU citizenship, endorsing citizens' concerns in formulating EU policies and promoting participative democracy.
20121022-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20121022-18:49:22_15 to enjoy protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of any Member State in a third country
20121022-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20121022-18:49:22_12 All EU citizens must be informed and enjoy without discrimination all the rights granted to them by Union law and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, i.e.
20121022-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20121022-18:49:22_21 In view of the forthcoming European elections, we must raise awareness of the legislative powers of the European Parliament and encourage citizens to vote so that their voice is heard clearly by EU decision makers.
20121022-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20121022-18:49:22_18 to address the institutions of the Union to enjoy the free movement of goods and services, consumer protection, public health, equal opportunities, equal treatment, access to employment and social protection to enjoy the new right of the European Citizens Initiative granted by the Lisbon Treaty, and to strengthen participative democracy through access to documents, information, good governance and administration.
20121022-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20121022-18:49:22_10 At a time of economic, political, and social crisis only twenty months before the next European elections, putting Union citizenship and participative democracy at the centre of the political agenda is absolutely essential.
20121022-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20121022-18:49:22_16 to petition the European Parliament
20151027-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20151027-16:20:10_4 that we need to support EASO in order that people arriving can have their asylum application properly proceed.
20151027-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20151027-16:20:10_6 The second point is that we have to change the nomenclature of the AMIF budget lines because putting integration and return together in one budget line is just avoiding being clear on where the money is being spent.
20151027-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20151027-16:20:10_1 But of course we have some questions on details. These are matters of tremendous political importance that we need to debate.
20151027-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20151027-16:20:10_5 I also wonder why Europol should receive the same increase in funding and staff as EASO.
20180115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20180115-18:04:58_5 So you had a very energy efficient aeroplane and then it could fly on solar.
20160412-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20160412-23:17:09_1 development was lifted to an equal footing with diplomacy and defence.
20160412-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20160412-23:17:09_4 We have to fight against poverty and promote ecologically, economically and socially sustainable development all over the world.
20160412-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20160412-23:17:09_6 In development policy we have to act in close cooperation with the United States, since in this field our basic values, goals and interests are very close to each other.
20160412-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20160412-23:17:09_7 This is also how we can most effectively tackle the root causes of our recent security and migration challenges.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_8 Saying a firm no' to FGM for me also means that we have to have protective laws and we have to provide strong support to the grassroots organisations that work on this.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_6 This is a simple 3D print that I think every woman should be proud to be in possession of, because knowing your body is also a way to take back control, to take back power.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_10 Today we see the attacks on women's bodies from the likes of Trump with his awful gag rule that wants to threaten women's sexual and reproductive health and rights worldwide.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_14 We say no to all forms of patriarchal control over our bodies, and we say yes to sexual freedom and choice for women and for proper sexuality education where we can learn about our rights, our women's rights and our bodies, and about the clitoris.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_2 It has nothing to do with religion, but it has all to do with patriarchy.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_12 These struggles are linked.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_4 Many people don't even know what it looks like, and the dictionaries in 2017 still get it wrong.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_3 It is also symptomatic for me that the clitoris almost everywhere has been systematically neglected and erased.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_13 We say no to FGM, support grassroots organisations.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_1 As colleagues have said, approximately 130 to 140 million women and girls have been victims of FGM. FGM is older than Christianity or Islam.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_7 This is being used by many FGM activists that fight against FGM, and it gives us the power to protect it.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_11 Colleagues, Commission, our message must be clear.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170201-20:07:57_9 But saying no to FGM also demands that we say no to all forms of patriarchal control of our bodies.
20170404-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170404-10:00:04_2 In past years, all our attention was focused on the lowering of CO2 emissions and particulate matter, without devoting enough attention to NOx.
20170404-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170404-10:00:04_4 With the new proposal we are introducing new real driving emissions tests that are closest to real world use, and we will also introduce new type approval legislation that will help diesel cars to become much cleaner, but we do not need new agencies for that.
20170404-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170404-10:00:04_6 We should use this period to prepare new development plans focusing on new innovative technologies in order to safeguard Europe's position as the number one car maker in the world.
20170404-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170404-10:00:04_1 We need stronger rules that will effectively deal with the emission problems for diesel cars.
20170404-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170404-10:00:04_5 For the upcoming years the classic technologies based on fossil fuels and the alternative solutions will be present side by side.
20170404-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170404-09:52:16_7 But, at the same time, there is still some disappointing information.
20180502-0900-PLENARY-29-en_20180502-22:29:15_2 As the rapporteur has stated we tackled very important topics like fake news, whistle blowers, geo blocking and licences, always defending freedom of expression which is the crucial and the central point of our concern.
20140310-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20140310-19:50:52_2 and now we have a decision that for the first time in this Parliament has been rejected by all the political groups and all the committees with a huge majority almost unanimity.
20090219-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090219-09:28:09_8 I almost feel sorry for the Commission.
20090219-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090219-09:28:09_0 Madam President, it is hard to believe that we are sitting here today discussing minor changes to the rules on value added tax when EU countries are facing the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression.
20090219-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090219-09:28:09_14 No doubt the gestures towards European Union will continue, but democratically elected governments have a primary interest in looking after the populations that elected them.
20090219-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090219-09:28:09_13 Never mind that prudent government finances are essential to the survival of the euro, there is nothing else that these countries can do about their budgets.
20090219-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090219-09:28:09_7 Probably of even more serious concern is the huge exposure of several euro zone countries to defaulting debts of Eastern Europe.

20121119-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20121119-19:02:03_1 Bearing in mind the guidelines for colorectal cancer screening from 2010, last week I hosted the conference which launched a White Paper setting the standards for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care of colorectal cancer across Europe.
20170705-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20170705-22:50:15_6 If we take so long with a rule of law country like Singapore, imagine how long we will take with bigger, more problematic countries.
20121121-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20121121-19:54:34_1 With cyber criminals getting better at breaking into protected networks, I strongly believe that the only real way to win the battle is to have people with similar knowledge and expertise fighting against them.
20120703-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120703-20:30:20_0 Mr President, even though I thought I got your message that I should not ask for the floor, I will do it anyway.
20120703-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120703-20:30:20_2 I think that it is actually a fundamental right to have a basic bank account.
20110705-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20110705-11:13:29_3 Governments feel the scepticism of public opinion and try to transfer responsibility to the Commission.
20110705-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20110705-11:13:29_5 The EU is, therefore, in a hypocritical situation where the Council does not approve GMOs, but some Member States cultivate them.
20110705-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20110705-11:13:29_7 Usually our group is a proponent of a Community approach, but in this particular case we should not have a one size fits all policy.
20110705-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20110705-11:13:29_8 The inclusion of complementary environmental reasons as well as a list of social and economic grounds for the restriction or prohibition of GMOs by Member States will make this report more legally solid.
20171026-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171026-10:54:34_0 Mr President, any operator that is responsible for damage to the environment must be held accountable for their actions.
20171026-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171026-10:54:34_1 However, the determination of the accountability should be down to the Member State.
20171026-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171026-10:54:34_3 You mention the establishment of a secondary liability regime based upon the systems already adopted by several Member States
20171026-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171026-10:54:34_6 This is typical of the EU implementing more and more unnecessary legislation.
20171026-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171026-10:54:34_7 The report calls for the consideration of a European fund for the remedying of environmental damage.
20171026-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171026-10:54:34_10 So if you propose this fund who is going to pay for it?
20110308-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20110308-17:10:15_4 nan
20090505-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090505-09:58:21_1 As MEPs, I hope that we can send a strong message on behalf of those citizens that we are in favour of a free Internet, where the privacy of users and their rights are respected fully. Today we must stand behind the block of citizens' amendments that have been tabled, as the best way of defending those rights of our citizens.
20090505-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090505-09:58:21_2 These amendments, if passed, will restore some sort of balance between end users' rights and freedoms and the rights and freedoms of others, including the right to intellectual property protection and indeed the right to privacy.
20090505-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090505-09:58:21_3 The aim of this proposal should be to protect those who need protection, but also to strengthen the rights of citizens to access information within the law when and where they see fit.
20090505-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090505-09:58:21_4 Service providers should be made to act in a transparent manner at all times and, if in very exceptional cases restrictions to access are required, they should be fully accountable in justifying these restrictions.
20090505-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090505-09:58:21_5 National powers should have a role in investigating any restriction that service providers impose.
20150611-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150611-10:25:51_0 Mr President, for the moment, the cultural cleansing undertaken by Daesh at other precious sites they have seized has not taken place at Palmyra, one of the greatest of all cultural treasures of the Middle East.
20150611-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150611-10:25:51_2 Indeed, the destruction of such sites is in fact contrary to Islamic scholarship, where previous civilisations and the learning and architecture of antiquity was studied, preserved, often incorporated and, in a positive sense, used.
20150611-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150611-10:25:51_3 As my colleague Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, has put it this is not a clash of civilizations
20150611-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150611-10:25:51_1 As a former UNESCO World Heritage Site chairman myself, the thought that this wondrous jewel could be destroyed concerns me and so many others deeply, never forgetting that probably over 1 people have lost their lives in and around the site.

20151014-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20151014-20:02:22_2 Member States because, in the digital single market, more and more personal data of people from one Member State will be collected, stored and used in other Member States.
20170912-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20170912-17:25:18_2 They would have some effect. But I think we need to pay attention to the loopholes.
20170912-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20170912-17:25:18_6 They collaborate, supporting each other.
20170517-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20170517-21:49:41_6 So in this regard, we really would like to see in future a much more proactive and cooperative role from the Commission side, otherwise it will be very difficult for us to cooperate.
20130205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20130205-09:52:51_1 However, Madam Commissioner, there was a key measure missing from your proposal.
20130205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20130205-09:52:51_5 nan
20130205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20130205-09:52:51_3 This will allow us to restore levels of fish and increase the income of fishermen throughout the European Union by increasing both the quantity and the size of fish caught.
20170214-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20170214-19:29:00_2 I also would like to welcome the constitutional reform Albania has been successfully going through, which is a very difficult task we all understand that but we also know that when it comes to judicial reform it is the implementation which is the most difficult and the most important task. If Albania engages in this reform process according to its envisaged reform strategy, we will be very satisfied with that.
20130415-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130415-17:35:01_0 Mr President, I think that is a very reasonable question. Yes, of course, we cannot only use market based instruments.
20130415-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130415-17:35:01_1 I think we should also use other instruments, such as regulation for instance.
20130415-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130415-17:35:01_2 We have just adopted an energy efficiency directive that will definitely also point us in the right direction.
20130415-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130415-17:35:01_3 But because this is a huge, massive problem, there needs to be a fundamental change in the way we consume and produce energy.
20130415-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130415-17:35:01_6 So we need to use what we have now, and that is the ETS system.
20130415-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130415-17:45:36_1 You probably know how busy we are.
20120911-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20120911-17:07:34_2 4000 days and nights nearly eleven years.
20090310-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20090310-19:11:19_3 I am a recent participant in the Twitter' site and I have to say that I am more than surprised and impressed at how much information is on that site from the European Union. It gives a huge amount of information and I would like to congratulate them on that.
20150429-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20150429-11:27:20_3 I am sure that this quest for freedom is universal and that the EU has a moral obligation and a strategic interest to avoid more tragedies in the Mediterranean by promoting peace, security and the rule of law in a firmer and more assertive way in the countries of origin.
20150429-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20150429-11:27:20_2 While she was thankful for reaching the free world, she became really happy only when her homeland was finally freed from oppression and we eventually came back to Croatia.
20150519-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150519-10:48:07_4 We know that there is a shortage of skilled labour in this area. At the same time, there are a lot of people who will lose their jobs and will need retraining.
20150519-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150519-10:48:07_10 We hope that we will go all together
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-20:08:31_2 The DSA must improve the framework for digital service providers to stimulate growth, but it must also make the fight against illegal content more successful and it must improve transparency and oversight.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-20:08:31_4 Either we develop AI based on our own values and with economic benefits or we end up using AI developed on other continents without those values and without a large part of the economic benefits.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-20:08:31_5 A strong risk—based approach offers the best way forward here. These challenges are difficult, but I fully support the efforts of all the rapporteurs here today. We are not even close to a satisfying legal situation, but these reports are an excellent start.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_3 And some people born in a different time, like myself, might want to go back to how it was before, because it seems like a simpler time.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_7 The future will be more digital, not less, and it brings incredible progress that we, as policymakers, should embrace.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_9 also brings dangers that we cannot ignore anymore.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_10 Let us be honest with each other, colleagues. The EU has done more to regulate the online world than any other continent.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_12 Over the past decades, we have not followed up on illegal content and illegal activities online with the same rigour as we have illegal activities offline.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_13 We have not achieved any meaningful transparency over how algorithms push content to users on a massive scale.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_14 We have not grasped the impact of it on our democracies, our culture and our fundamental rights.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_15 Instead, we have focused on voluntary cooperation, which is good, but not good enough.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_16 Not nearly good enough.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_18 We cannot leave this to the private sector without oversight and enforcement. We must keep this in the public debate as a priority and we must regulate, no matter how technical these files are.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_19 The difficult challenge before us is to find the balance between digital progress and respect for fundamental rights.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_21 The value of lawmaking is the real change it effects.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_22 If we start off with conflicting regulations and directives that undermine each other instead of complementing each other, we have lost the battle before it starts.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_23 We must respect the scope of each digital file.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_24 Secondly, the fundamentals of the e commerce Directive were great, but its greatest issue was transparency.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_25 We must improve and enforce meaningful transparency, and I call for a clear mandate from this Parliament.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_26 Thirdly, we all agree on the importance of notice and action mechanisms to remove illegal content online, but this places the burden almost entirely on users. We therefore should complement notice and action with clear and appropriate obligations to remove illegal content, and it's the public authorities who should provide the funding to follow up on this.
20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_27 Finally, I would like of course personally to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all my colleagues on the LIBE DSA report for their excellent cooperation.
20180116-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180116-10:45:18_1 They established some priorities
20180116-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180116-10:45:18_5 To our children and young people, we have to partner titles on theoretical topics with, above all, practical values.
20180116-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180116-10:45:18_6 Indeed, education and culture have to do with civilisation.
20180530-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180530-16:04:28_2 Golden visas have a negative impact on the status of EU residence and citizenship.
20180530-0900-PLENARY-30-en_20180530-22:53:56_4 Let me outline briefly what the Commission is already doing to improve its implementation.
20150910-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20150910-11:06:41_1 We are worried by the deteriorating situation when it comes to respect for human rights persecution of political opponents and journalists is becoming a rule in this country full of contrast, a country which is on the one hand incredibly rich in oil and diamonds, and on the other hand has one of the highest rates of child mortality in the world.
20150910-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20150910-11:06:41_2 It is the corrupt elites who are depriving the people of Angola of their basic human rights access to healthcare, food and education by stealing public money intended for basic social services. We are seriously concerned about the possible mismanagement of EU development funds by the local authorities, and in this regard we are asking the Commission to review the national indicative programme under the 11th EDF and to ensure that good governance, respect for human rights and the fight against corruption are the main financing priorities for this fabulously rich country, which suffers also from a fabulously corrupt elite.
20150910-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20150910-11:06:41_0 Mr President, after decades of conflict and instability, Angola continues to face the major challenges of weak governance, human rights abuses and widespread corruption.
20130313-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20130313-19:12:10_3 However, it should be a decision taken by the EU as a whole, and of course, coordinated with the US, Turkey and the Arab League.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_5 It is important that Facebook is not only relying on ads, as they say is their business model, but is also delivering for trust by delivering solutions and actions in the way of how they do their business model.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_3 But I would also agree it is very important to understand that there is a missing brick in this wall, and that is the e privacy regulation.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_8 We need to get more rules in place, especially also for consumer control to get connectivity across the platforms in order to have a choice.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_6 The business model of just earning money by using the data of individuals has to change, because that's not only Facebook's business model.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_4 We still need to fix that problem because the communication data needs to be protected in a specific way.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_2 We can be very proud, as the European Union and, especially as Parliament, that we have a tool to protect the privacy and integrity of our citizens' lives with the GDPR in place.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-16:49:49_2 It's about fundamental rights, privacy awareness, but privacy enforcement as well namely, the right to be forgotten, enshrined by the GDPR.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-16:49:49_3 But it is also about democracy, because fake news is a hybrid war of intoxication, manipulation, lies and hate speech aimed to weaken democracy through interfering in elections and enhancing populism and Europhobia. So it takes a European response, which means that no Member State can do it on its own before a giant in the internet, like Facebook, but also legal, binding and effective law. But it takes action. That means that doing nothing is not a choice.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-16:49:49_4 That is what the European citizens are expecting from all of us, and that is precisely and exactly what we ask from you.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-16:49:49_5 The European Commission must take initiative action and now.
20150907-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20150907-18:47:26_6 Upholding these values is of crucial importance for the proper functioning of the European Union, because they guarantee that Member States fulfil their international law obligations and that they can trust each other and the institutions of the European Union.
20150907-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20150907-18:47:26_4 The European Union was founded on the principles of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
20150907-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20150907-18:47:26_12 Failing to do so may have severe consequences, including the possibility of the European Union falling apart. Almost 60 years have passed since its foundation.
20150907-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20150907-18:47:26_10 right before our eyes.
20150907-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20150907-18:47:26_3 This report also has other important implications for the fundamental rights of minorities Roma children, women and LGBTI people and for those seeking asylum.
20150907-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20150907-18:47:26_9 This has been proved in the last couple of years and must be rectified. That is why in this report we call for a new mechanism that is automatically triggered in cases of breaches of fundamental values and rights, to remedy the breaches, to avoid the materialisation of systematic threats in Member States. Our common European fundamental values are being threatened first and foremost from within,
20180207-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180207-19:52:58_7 Too narrow a focus means that we will be missing some targets.
20180207-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180207-19:52:58_8 Too many mandates at the same time can lead to fragmentation and to high costs.
20180207-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180207-19:52:58_9 We should keep finding the right balance and finding the trade—offs, to be focused and efficient in the work and the EIB.
20110706-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20110706-18:21:36_2 This can be done through various programmes and the exchange of best practices and know how and by assuring the availability of necessary funding for education, training, awareness raising and empowerment for women as well as for the continuous fight against gender violence, stereotypes and discrimination.
20180118-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20180118-15:31:41_3 it is about jobs, and it is about money.
20180118-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20180118-15:31:41_4 I understand that we are involved in a big legal battle with Norway, and I believe that we can find enough good lawyers to win this battle.
20180118-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20180118-15:31:41_2 It is about European citizens' trust in the European Commission and institutions
20180502-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180502-15:46:21_7 Let me give you a few examples.
20170911-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20170911-21:13:53_0 Madam President, I have listened carefully to the debate today and I am encouraged by the engagement of the Members of this House.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-15:50:02_9 We need to speak about gender equality and we need to counteract racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-15:50:02_1 I was in the arrivals hall waiting to go out through customs when we heard and felt the first explosion.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-15:50:02_10 No rifles or surveillance technology in the world can do that.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-15:50:02_2 Then the second explosion came, and some of us thought that the roof was coming down upon us.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-15:50:02_4 My body remembers that fear, and it is in that feeling that I reject those who say that we have to learn to live with this. Terrorism is man—made, and we can undo it.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-16:04:50_1 It is time to step back for a moment, to just pause and think through the implications of our actions until now.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-16:04:50_2 Are we taking the right measures to invest massively in better equipment, better cooperation between our police and security services, and effective deradicalisation, or are we still putting forward expensive, but ineffective and symbolic, measures of mass data collection or intrusive surveillance measures against completely innocent citizens,
20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-16:04:50_3 thereby weakening effective security and our freedoms together which we defend?
20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-16:04:50_4 Therefore, I am very happy that Commissioner King is starting to investigate the effectiveness of the hundreds of security measures which the European Union and its Member States have adopted through the years.
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-11:36:19_3 If this is what you are calling for, then welcome back into Europe.
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_3 However, the most offensive position that you have taken is the proposal that Spain will have the right to veto any Brexit deal over the issue of Gibraltar.
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_5 I do, however, have a solution to prevent Gibraltar being used as a pawn in Brexit negotiations and, indeed, end Spanish claims once and for all. Make Gibraltar a fully integrated part of the UK
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_9 I have been calling for this for many, many years, and with the unique opportunities that Brexit has given us, I believe it is an idea whose time has come.
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_7 Give Gibraltar real influence and a voice in Westminster and send a clear message that Gibraltar is not for sale.
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_6 give her and our other overseas territories their own Member of Parliament.
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_8 In this area, we, the UK, can learn from our continental cousins, because the French give representation to their overseas territories, and I propose that we should too.
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_2 This, I guarantee, would cause immense damage to the economies of the European Union and would result in putting many of your citizens out of work. It is what we call, in the UK, cutting off your nose to spite your face.
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_4 nan
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-11:30:17_1 First, our position, our attitude as committed pro Europeans, is very well described in Hamlet when Horatio describes the expression of the father of Hamlet a countenance more in sorrow than in anger' that will be our attitude in our negotiation.
20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:32:53_1 I will just underline four ideas that seem to me of the utmost importance on the subject.
20180702-0900-PLENARY-en_20180702-21:01:48_5 However, it is a step that should not be taken lightly.
20180702-0900-PLENARY-en_20180702-19:18:18_3 For me as an MEP, the effects of climate change on the rights of indigenous people are really very close to my heart, because the warming climate is the direct, or indirect, cause of many of the violations against their rights.
20180702-0900-PLENARY-en_20180702-19:18:18_4 We need to understand and be aware of that.
20121119-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20121119-21:10:43_2 Budget consolidation needs to be complemented by a social investment strategy that will address the social, employment and education targets of the EU 2020 Strategy.
20090423-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20090423-12:07:10_3 Not only have I had no answer, but his office refused to respond to my e mails.
20131119-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20131119-20:04:13_5 Gender diversity on boards leads to more sustainable decisions and therefore to a more resistant European economy.
20090504-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20090504-22:11:56_6 I would, therefore, like to stress again the importance of reaching first reading agreement on an issue which is so important to European Union citizens.
20170705-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170705-11:22:54_1 Estonia has chosen four main objectives for the next six months.
20170705-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170705-11:22:54_2 The logical order of these four objectives seems clear. The inclusive and sustainable Europe that Estonia wants to promote, as the fourth objective, will be closer if the first three objectives are achieved.
20170705-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170705-11:22:54_4 These three goals may certainly facilitate a more inclusive and sustainable Europe.
20170705-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170705-11:22:54_10 I am confident and convinced that, in the months to come, Estonia will go in the direction of denouncing any breach of fundamental rights in the European Union.
20111213-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20111213-22:38:55_4 I question the validity of REACH to do so, because so far we have not restricted one single substance using the REACH system.
20111213-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20111213-22:38:55_5 So that was my question if it is really appropriate and if it will work.
20120314-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20120314-15:57:49_2 Let me say that such a policy shift would be a strategic blunder. The EU should continue to do what it is doing, only do it better.
20120314-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20120314-15:57:49_7 Therefore, I would say that recent events in Russia and the presidential elections actually present a case for staying the course in terms of our policy.
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:58:09_5 Iran sees some of its citizens as threats. Repression happens to real people, people with family and friends.
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:58:09_8 So my question is basically what is the Commission doing to prevent the execution of these innocent people, who only dream of democracy and freedom?
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:27:34_2 And since the Iranian options are limited, and their cash flow is limited, and their foreign currencies are limited, they might very well offer, as a quid pro quo, naval bases or air bases to Russian or Chinese military in the Middle East, and this is of course all bad news, very bad news, for anyone living in Israel, in Lebanon, in Yemen, but also in the European Union.
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:27:34_11 As coordinator for the JCPOA, which we fully support, and also as a diplomatic success from the European Union, I would ask you in the next 11 days and beyond to do your utmost best.
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:27:34_4 nan
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:27:34_6 Any alternative means to find a solution is welcome because Beijing will sell its arms.
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:27:34_8 Are we still on the same page?
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:27:34_9 Are talks with Europe, with Beijing and Moscow ongoing? Can you assure me that we are doing everything that we can to restrain?
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:27:34_1 The Iranian Foreign Minister has welcomed it, and 11 days from now, like the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has said, a new phase in military cooperation between Iran and the world will commence.
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:27:34_3 Debates, however, seem to be concentrating on whoever gets the ticket in the White House.
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:27:34_10 Is there still hope to limit arms sales?
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-10:39:42_1 There is no way other than a peaceful solution out of this long ongoing conflict. International peace needs to be an international endeavour.
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-10:39:42_2 It is therefore absolutely unacceptable that countries such as Turkey, for example, contribute with mercenaries, among other things, to worsen the situation even more. The EU is a region built on the idea that dialogue is the only way forward for long lasting peace. It is our duty at the same time to take leadership for those ideas in our neighbouring countries.
20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-10:39:42_3 I am glad that the international community is ready to assist and the EU needs to support the ongoing process in the OSCE.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170215-18:22:52_2 That is what we have to improve and I really appreciate that you are taking this on your agenda and I would really see that Member States are supporting you in making better use of these systems.
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_9 So, yes, in the beginning of this huge transition we will still need fossil fuels and, therefore, EU policies should support carbon capture, enable government support schemes for blue hydrogen, and I expect the Commission to move forward in this direction in its energy summer package.
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_1 No, our biggest problem is that the perfect is becoming the enemy of the good.
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_7 in infrastructure, in the scale up of electrolysers, but also in carbon capture utilisation and storage, because we need to be realistic.
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_3 Well, altogether that is not a sustainable posture.
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_5 But luckily there's one technology we all agree on that has the potential to decarbonise at least our heavy industries and transport hydrogen.
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_10 We have 30 years to reshape our entire energy system and we can do it, and we will fail if we demand to be perfect, but we will definitely succeed by doing it as good as we can.
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_2 And just look at the political debates no nuclear energy please, no carbon capture that entails fossil fuels, no biomass, no gas in a transition, no windmills in my backyard and no solar panels on agricultural grounds please.
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_4 How can we possibly be serious in reaching our climate goals without technologies like carbon capture, biomass or nuclear?
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_6 It might not be a silver bullet but we all agree this energy carrier has enormous potential and our aim is clear to create a new, clean produced, green hydrogen market and a long—term certainty for all parties involved, and that requires massive investments
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_8 If we want to pave the way for clean hydrogen we will initially need to invest in transitional technologies and these might not be perfect but they are good.
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-10:48:45_1 Welcoming criminals into our European Union with open arms, just because those criminals are rich, is totally outrageous and means forfeiting that trust because, regardless of what the Cypriot, Maltese, Bulgarian or any other government thinks, access
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-10:48:45_2 to one EU country's passport also means access to the whole EU, with all the benefits that it takes years for normal people to enjoy, even though they might have been exemplary inhabitants.
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-10:48:45_3 This is not having sincere cooperation, nor is it upholding the integrity of what EU citizenship should mean. Convicted oligarchs and corrupt businessmen have nothing to do here in the EU.
20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-10:48:45_5 My second question is also why doesn't it include all the countries who have this kind of system in place, referring to the infringement process, of course.
20130610-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20130610-19:01:06_2 In this respect, we welcome all efforts to maintain common safety standards, to put in place vigorous protection measures, strict controls and training in safety procedures, as well as to enforce regular risk assessments and preventive measures by employers.
20171212-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171212-19:53:15_1 We should not be hypercritical, clinging formally to the letter of the Treaty and taking it as an excuse to look away from the real situation.
20150910-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150910-09:12:58_1 They hinder the delivery of tangible benefits for our citizens and pose problems for those wishing to live, work or do business across borders. It is time to put people at the heart of EU policy making by identifying problematic areas, dismantling barriers to citizens and improving implementation in ways which result in concrete benefits in the daily lives of our citizens.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171114-09:21:49_3 They are harming competition, they are creating unfair ways of increasing inequality.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171114-09:21:49_1 Maybe most of them are actually legal but they matter, not only because in the view of many people they are immoral they matter because they are harming our society.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171114-09:21:49_10 We can not only lead by example, but more decisively use soft and hard powers to persuade the others that are making the game unfair.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171114-09:21:49_16 And in some cases, do not be afraid to go for harmonisation.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171114-09:21:49_12 This is the moment where I have to turn to the Finance Ministers, because they have the power.
20171211-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20171211-21:06:24_1 much to be worried about persecution of opposition and journalists and therefore I think the EU has to stand up first for European values and condition enhanced cooperation on convincing progress in the field of human rights.
20170314-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20170314-19:47:58_4 That is evident from the recently leaked cables, with one participant stating that it was impressive to see how some Member States presented themselves outwardly as proponents of tax reform and, at the same time to watch, in the Code of Conduct Group, how they actually behave in EU discussions protected by confidentiality.
20170314-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20170314-19:47:58_10 I actually listen to my constituents and I know they are furious about tax dodging by both businesses and individuals.
20170314-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20170314-19:35:02_8 As I said, there is no room for complacency and many things have to be done.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170315-22:06:27_1 Ahead of the meeting, as we know, some EU leaders voiced concerns about external destabilising influences on the region, and these have been mentioned again tonight.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170315-22:06:27_2 I believe our response has to be ever more visible and strong engagement in the region to support those forces that fight for human rights and the rule of law.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170315-22:06:27_3 The EU is a peace project, a project that aims to end frequent and bloody wars between neighbours, horrible experiences that the Western Balkans know only too well.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170315-22:06:27_4 The prospect of European integration for Montenegro and the Western Balkans is therefore essential for peace in the region and across Europe.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170315-22:06:27_5 As the Commissioner noted, Montenegro continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to EU integration.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170315-22:06:27_6 Its steady progress in opening chapters is not only bringing it closer to EU accession, but, as many others have said, is also providing a positive example for other countries in the region.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170315-22:06:27_7 My group tabled a number of amendments to the report, specifically focused on enhancing human rights.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170315-22:06:27_8 I am pleased that many of these are reflected in the report, covering topics from ensuring media freedom to improving working conditions for civil society, to better arrangements for victims of gender based violence, to eliminating obstacles to health care, education, housing and employment for Roma people.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_6 I am referring to that because we are at a crossroads.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_24 I think the fast track the Commission and Parliament are now attributing is an achievement because its bottom up.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_22 A second issue which is important and also an achievement for Parliament is that we are reflecting on the fact that we are living in an ever changing innovation environment. It's new, it's fast, it's ambitious, it's driven by VC capital and it's competitive.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_8 But we failed.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_13 We want to tackle children's cancer.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_31 For the first time, we don't fight the fight between CO2 reduction and competitiveness, we just focus on energy production. What we are going to say is yes, it's not a contradiction both to do CO2 reduction and to be competitive, but we have to do something about that and that is to focus on manufacturing. We want to have CO2 free steel plants.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_15 We are leading but we have to do something about that leadership and we want to have a quantum computer 10 years from now.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_11 It's not for soapbox speeches, it's not for the sake of academic life it is about the substance of the well being of this continent.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_4 The reason for the well being of this continent relates, starting in the 18th century, to its ability to innovate.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_20 This is the continent which is open to the world
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_19 We don't want to have an America First' like the United States.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_27 Are we fast enough in the international context?'
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_5 The historic legacy of the Enlightenment is very much related to that.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_21 we are not naive, but we want to ask the world to work together with us.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_29 It's a game changer that we have more of a bottom up approach.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_32 We want to have more ambition but we want to align CO2 reduction and competition.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_16 I think what's important to understand is that this is not just another programme, that it is one of the biggest contributions to the European economy, but also to the well being of European citizens.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_12 I think what we are going to achieve with that programme is, first of all, going back and tackling the big challenges which are related to the ordinary life of citizens.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_14 In terms of technology, we want to have a quantum computer.
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_25 If you're a researcher, if you're an innovator, if you're smart, if you're innovative, you can go to the Commission and say in the framework of what has been decided in the programme, do we get funding?
20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_1 We owe to the labour of our working population in Europe, but the basis of our well being is innovation.
20101124-0900-PLENARY-26-en_20101124-12:25:01_1 by the DPRK on a south Korean island.
20101124-0900-PLENARY-26-en_20101124-12:25:01_5 We also expect China to clearly condemn this act.
20101124-0900-PLENARY-26-en_20101124-12:25:01_2 There have been severe casualties among the South Korean military and especially among the civilian population of that island.
20101124-0900-PLENARY-26-en_20101124-12:25:01_4 We welcome that Baroness Ashton, the High Representative, has acted in a concerned manner with other international actors, our allies and our strategic partner, the Republic of Korea, in condemning this clear violation of the UN Korean Armistice Agreement.
20101124-0900-PLENARY-26-en_20101124-12:25:01_6 We call upon the DPRK to avoid any further escalation and to undertake all necessary efforts to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
20131007-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131007-20:14:10_9 Such prevention presupposes major commitment as well as sustained and concerted efforts by the Commission, by the national governments of countries experiencing such phenomena, by civil society, international agencies and other stakeholders.
20131007-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131007-20:14:10_6 and stereotypes against women, preventing them from fully enjoying equal treatment in employment and educational opportunities in many countries.
20131007-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131007-20:14:10_2 This is a rising but under reported problem in several countries.
20180912-0900-PLENARY-en_20180912-21:30:55_7 You know what I am talking about.
20180912-0900-PLENARY-en_20180912-21:30:55_5 But even worse than those billions is the frustration and anger when a tourist, an artist and we love them, we proved this today a company proprietor or a worker, a student, a patient or a doctor cannot find that necessary information, such as a form to fill out when he or she encounters problems when delivering documents online. This portal will help to solve those problems. I find it especially important today, when some politicians call Europe an imaginary community,
20150210-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150210-12:38:08_1 We would all like to see jobs back in Europe.
20150210-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150210-12:38:08_2 We had a very good discussion on youth unemployment prior to this discussion. I really think that we have an obligation to look into all possibilities for supporting growth and job creation.
20150210-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150210-12:38:08_3 In this perspective one perhaps minor, but important, thing could be employee financial participation EFP
20150210-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150210-12:38:08_4 EFP can strengthen small and medium sized enterprises, offering mechanisms for innovative financing, as workers may wish to invest in shares in the company by which they are employed.
20150210-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150210-12:38:08_5 Despite these possible benefits, the focus on EFP varies from Member State to Member State.
20150210-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150210-12:38:08_6 This is the reason why I am participating in this very important debate today, because when it comes to employee share ownership and employee financial participation, the Commission and Parliament as was mentioned by my colleague from the EPP Group earlier on have been doing a lot of talking.
20150210-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150210-12:38:08_7 We have done studies and have collected information, data and knowledge.
20150210-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150210-12:38:08_8 Now I think it is time to act.
20150210-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150210-12:38:08_9 I would like to ask the Commissioner a very simple question.
20150210-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150210-12:38:08_10 Are you planning to put forward a proposal for an action plan on this issue?
20150210-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150210-12:38:08_12 We have adopted an opinion on employee financial participation, we have made several studies, we have adopted a resolution, we have completed a pilot project and so on.
20110928-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20110928-17:48:32_7 I am sure that this was a mistake and I hope you will fix that.
20180312-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180312-22:11:27_9 In Poland, the Catching Up' region initiative has helped, for example, to improve the conditions for starting a business, the management of financial instruments, or special planning practices.
20180312-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180312-22:11:27_12 I understand very well that some of you may think that we are demanding too much but, on the other hand, we all know that challenges in the quality of governance hinder the performance of public investments.
20180312-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180312-22:11:27_3 I very much welcome the main finding of these reports.
20150114-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20150114-16:56:40_4 Instead of reinstating border checks and undermining one of the EU's fundamental freedoms, we need closer coordination among our security and law enforcement agencies. Instead of gathering ever greater amounts of data and undermining civil liberties, we need more effective, intelligence sharing to connect the dots from the information we already collect.
20171115-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171115-10:11:28_7 This is the way in which this Polish authority, this Polish Government, this Polish majority, acts.
20171115-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171115-10:11:28_8 Sophia in t Veld was totally right when she explained that. It is apodictic it is absolute
20171115-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171115-10:11:28_9 we are all wrong
20171115-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171115-10:11:28_10 we have no idea what is happening there
20171115-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171115-10:11:28_11 we get it all wrong and they are all right.
20171115-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171115-10:11:28_12 The problem in Poland is that they are trying to change the state and to model it so that generations to come will have no chance to change it back for the better.
20171115-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171115-10:11:28_13 That is the thing that we have to be concerned about, because there are millions and millions of Poles probably half of them, more than half of them that would still make up a pretty big Member State who want a future in Europe
20171115-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171115-10:11:28_14 who want a democratic future
20171115-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171115-10:11:28_16 Those Poles we are standing up for, because they have chosen to be part of the European society, and that is why we care.
20180502-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20180502-20:31:09_1 send their children to a special so called European School which is completely isolated from the rest of the world?
20170914-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170914-09:12:30_5 Our message is Discover your talent!'.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_2 At that time, we were focused on the whole business of the modernisation of competition policy, the significant amount of work taken forward by former Commissioner, Mario Monti, and by the current Commissioner, Neelie Kroes, and on looking at the impact of that in terms of the Commission's ability to deal with the abuse of market power and to deal more effectively with mergers and state aid.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_4 We have seen record activity on the part of the Commission in terms of dealing with hardcore cartels, we have seen the development of the leniency system, we have seen record fines put into operation by the Commission and we have seen record activity in terms of mergers and state aid notifications as well.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_10 However, I mention the change of context because, of course, we all recognise that since the reports were published by the Commission, the Commission's work in terms of state aid particularly has really taken on a rather different dimension.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_12 It is very important and our report says so that, in addressing those matters, we recognise some of the challenges that there are for an effective, open market.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_14 The banking sector in the United Kingdom at the moment is one very clear area where there will have to be, when economic circumstances become a little calmer, a general review of the new architecture that we have got and of whether that architecture really is compatible with the operation of a free, fair and open market.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_0 Mr President, the European Commission produces its annual competition report and it is traditional for the European Parliament to cast its eye over the report and to produce an own initiative reaction to it.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_6 That is something, similarly, that our committee and Parliament have been supportive of.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_1 In this case, because of timing factors, the reports for 2006 and 2007 have been brought together but taking up one of the points mentioned by Commissioner Barrot a little earlier it is the case that the context of our consideration of these reports has changed rather markedly, since we in fact began the exercise of considering the report some time ago.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_7 Our committee has drawn attention to two specific concerns what we regard as being the unequal relationship between producers and retailers, particularly in relation to food retailing.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_13 It is very important that, when the Commission gives its approval, it is giving that approval in ways which are compatible with the Treaty and do not create such significant market power in future that it becomes a scenario for abuse in its own right.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_11 Almost on a daily basis, the Commission is now looking at the effect of the bail outs that are taking place in the context of the current financial turmoil.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_3 By and large, that has been a very good story in these reports and this is very clear from the reaction that we have from Parliament's own report.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_5 This is a process that is gathering pace in terms of modernisation because the Commission is currently bringing forward proposals, in a White Paper, on introducing private damages.
20180702-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20180702-19:18:18_3 For me as an MEP, the effects of climate change on the rights of indigenous people are really very close to my heart, because the warming climate is the direct, or indirect, cause of many of the violations against their rights.
20180702-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20180702-19:18:18_4 We need to understand and be aware of that.
20121023-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20121023-22:06:22_6 Our chief incentive during negotiations has to be the implementation of the commitments made by Japan to eliminate non tariff barriers in various sectors, particularly the automotive sector.
20121023-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20121023-22:06:22_9 Now is not the time to say let's wait a few more months' or we need more concessions' now is the time to launch negotiations with Japan.
20121023-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20121023-22:06:22_1 We cannot accept that our two way trade with the world's third largest national economy amounts to only a quarter of our trade with the US or China.
20121023-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20121023-22:06:22_7 To ensure this I included a provision that if Japan has not delivered on its NTB commitments and has not demonstrated sufficient ambition in meeting the EU's priority demands, the Commission should stop negotiations, after consultations with the European Parliament and the Council.
20121023-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20121023-22:06:22_3 The Commission has estimated that nearly two thirds of such gains under the EU's trade policy would come from potential agreements with the US and Japan.
20171129-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171129-21:08:54_7 Yes, two days ago, something happened one port and Sanaa Airport were reopened, but it is far from being enough.
20120911-0900-PLENARY-23-en_20120911-20:08:54_3 We have to put productive things on the table.
20130206-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130206-19:55:00_7 You know that. I think you struggle and that you do everything you can, but you also have to admit that sometimes some countries are blocking.
20130206-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130206-19:55:00_9 Poland is now going to be President so we need to put maximum pressure on Poland to live up to that responsibility.
20130206-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130206-19:55:00_3 This is why we cannot wait until 2020. This is why it is all very well that we will get a legally binding agreement in 2015, but the COP process needs to create other results long before that.
20130206-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130206-19:55:00_5 This will only happen if the EU shows direction and, to be honest, we have not done that for a few years.
20130206-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130206-19:55:00_10 Can I ask you one question, Commissioner?
20130206-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130206-19:55:00_13 Why is it that one country can block progress for the European Union?
20130206-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130206-19:55:00_4 This will only happen if the EU leads.
20130206-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130206-19:55:00_8 Normally we are very polite and do not mention them, but today I would like to mention Poland unfortunately because Poland has been blocking.
20130206-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130206-19:55:00_6 I value your work, Commissioner.
20130206-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130206-20:20:24_8 It will seriously help us speed up the pace of negotiations and give the global climate agreement a chance.
20170911-0900-PLENARY-23-en_20170911-22:21:23_1 which is very much in line with the Commission's own policy and strategy.
20150706-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150706-22:31:39_0 Madam President, the Commission has recently provided help to the Hungarian Government in order to manage the flows of migrants entering the country.
20180530-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20180530-16:50:04_1 it should at least make sure that the gates are not closed to people who do not have badges.
20180530-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20180530-16:50:04_7 That's called investment?
20180530-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20180530-16:50:04_9 In Hungary, I suppose that in the good old days, when they were still running newspaper ads in order to sell their passports, the money had to be transferred into an offshore account that apparently belonged to the Government.

20180530-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20180530-16:50:04_12 There is citizenship by identification, integration, merit, and belief in what we stand for as nations and as the European Union.
20180530-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20180530-16:50:04_13 Madam Commissioner, I know that the Commission has limited means of action in this regard, but please condemn the practice, as clearly and as unequivocally as this House does, because only then are we going to get the more reluctant Member States to realise that what they are doing is wrong.
20090422-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20090422-21:33:05_1 Unfortunately, even the changes introduced by committee do not go far enough in improving the proposal.
20090422-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20090422-21:33:05_3 nan
20090422-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20090422-21:33:05_5 I believe, notwithstanding all of the hard work and goodwill, that MEPs should reject this proposal.
20090422-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20090422-21:33:05_2 It is a proposal which, I believe, will ultimately reward those artists that are already successful, and indeed reward the industry.
20090422-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20090422-21:33:05_6 I think the Commission needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with the right proposal, one that is not just about supporting performers and artists, but that in real and practical terms will deliver precisely that.
20130314-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20130314-15:35:00_4 for all Iraqi citizens in general, and the Turkmen in particular, because they have been numerously targeted on a large scale.

20130314-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20130314-15:35:00_6 Therefore, the EU should work closely with the Iraqi Government and use all the tools at its disposal to encourage the Iraqi Government to provide adequate protection to the Turkmen and other minorities.
20130314-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20130314-15:35:00_5 This resolution is not just for the Turkmen, it is for all the minority communities of Iraq who long for peace and security.

Despite the findings of Iraq's own High Commission for Human Rights, which acknowledges that the Turkmen have been subjected to terrorism, bombings, kidnappings and assassination, neither the Federal Government of Iraq nor the Kurdish regional government have done enough to provide security and protection
20160704-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20160704-17:45:12_2 Emission limits for non road mobile machinery might not sound like the sexiest subject, but it is an important piece of the jigsaw when it comes to tackling air pollution.
20160704-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20160704-17:45:12_8 The inconvenient truth for those who sought to argue the environmental benefits of a Britain outside the EU is that air pollution has an unfortunate habit of not respecting borders.
20160704-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20160704-17:45:12_6 Rather than allowing manufacturers to undercut each other in a race to the bottom on environmental standards, these ambitious and binding measures on NRMM will ensure industry is manufacturing progressively cleaner engines for these machines, which will go a long way to cleaning up toxic air pollution in the EU.
20160704-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20160704-17:45:12_9 Over one third of the UK's air pollution is blown in from across the English Channel.
20160704-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20160704-17:45:12_5 This proposal is a perfect example of how trade in a common market can also deliver environmental and health benefits for citizens.
20160704-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20160704-17:48:37_2 We have always suffered quite a lot of delays in many respects, and always we wanted to have our limits lower and higher, etc.
20160704-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20160704-17:48:37_3 But now a strict rule, a real vision of the future, is something we have to tell the people because this is the truth, our environment is in heavy danger.
20170313-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170313-18:46:20_7 Congratulations again to the rapporteur.
20170313-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170313-18:46:20_5 The EU's cap on bankers' bonuses was challenged by the British Government but largely supported by the British people, just as they support action to make CEO pay more accountable.
20170313-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170313-18:46:20_3 A survey of members of the Institute of Directors showed SMEs felt high pay in some big businesses was harming the reputation of all businesses.
20170313-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170313-18:46:20_4 So it is great that this directive takes action to improve pay transparency, as well as improving many other areas of corporate governance. Brexit cannot be used as an excuse for progress on this issue to be rolled back, particularly in Britain.
20170313-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170313-18:46:20_2 CEOs' pay has almost doubled over the last 10 years, while real pay for the average worker has stagnated. Dealing with this excessive remuneration is not anti business.
20170313-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170313-18:46:20_6 The message this directive sends must be heeded across the EU and in Britain, including after Brexit.

Unfortunately, the signals that we have received from insurance companies that have started to prepare the implementation of the IFRS 17 confirm the difficulties of this implementation.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20160526-10:37:48_0 Mr President, the single market is one of the most tangible results of European integration and yet, despite its significant achievements, citizens, consumers and businesses have become increasingly dissatisfied with it as it often fails to convince them that it truly represents their interests and their aspirations.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20160526-10:37:48_1 The main problem is that, in the average citizen's eyes, the market is more concerned with vested interests than it is with their needs.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20160526-10:37:48_2 We need to start working towards a fairer single market that is politically supported, economically viable and socially accepted by European citizens, a market that stimulates sustainable economic growth and job creation, but also considers citizens' hopes, fears and expectations.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20160526-10:37:48_3 The Comi report is an important step towards achieving a strong, green, knowledge based social market economy which by turning its focus back to its people will become a common asset of all its citizens, reduce unemployment, poverty, inequalities, social exclusion and wage dumping, promote respect of fundamental
20160526-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20160526-10:37:48_6 Therefore, I urge MEPs to support the report, and in particular the measures aimed at endorsing a highly competitive social market economy, providing consumers with the highest level of protection, promoting innovative start ups, SMEs and social economy enterprises, opposing abuses in the single market, which are trying to circumvent existing rules and lower
20160526-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20160526-10:37:48_7 worker and consumer and environmental standards, highlighting the economic, social and environmental benefits and challenges of the sharing economy, calling for a single European system for the protection of geographical indications for non agricultural products, and supporting the Made in' labelling, which is of crucial importance to protect consumers and provide them with the information they need.

20090204-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090204-09:07:32_1 Firstly, let me congratulate the Temporary Committee on Climate Change for all the work it has accomplished since its creation in April 2007 hearings, conferences, reports, resolutions, exchanges with third parties.
20090204-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090204-09:07:32_19 nan
20121212-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20121212-12:36:57_18 this is not my intention today. Right at the moment my fears go beyond concerns about basic human rights. I fear war, and I want to depict a vision
20121212-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20121212-12:36:57_23 wars in future. If this happens, human
20121212-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20121212-12:36:57_8 or others. Therefore, I would like to express my gratitude to the founders and organisers of the prize and salute Andrei Sakharov, whose fight for human rights and freedom became an excellent opportunity to talk about human beings and their basic rights. Two years ago, upon receiving my sentence, a friend asked me if I knew what the exact meaning of the sentence was. According to this friend, the message carried by the sentence
20121212-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20121212-12:36:57_12 I knew that I could no longer take my camera into the heart of this society and do the only thing I know how to do film making. Not making films is a slow death for a film maker. Always. And whenever I decided to prevent
20121212-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20121212-12:36:57_14 is the narrative of a few making the life of many miserable while using the most unacceptable excuses differences of race, sex, language, religion or political ideas. Unfortunately the authorities of my country
20121212-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20121212-12:36:57_9 was for me to run from my country and never come back. I still do not know if this interpretation was correct. However, if it was, I never understood why I had to leave my country, which I love dearly. This love goes way beyond geographical
20121212-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20121212-12:36:57_19 which speaks of this fear. Imagine a time when any form of artistic work or practice had vanished, and instead all you had is an array of weapons comforting bewildered humans. Perhaps this
20121212-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20121212-12:36:57_11 society I live in. My creation is the result of a personal perception of fact, of life and ontological experiences in my specific society during a lifetime. Run, or live with the sword of Damocles above my head that was the question. Eventually I chose to stay, even though
20121212-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20121212-12:36:57_17 the imprisoned demonstrators. Nasrin Sotoudeh is the outstanding example of such a situation. Sadly enough, we can go on mentioning many cases of extreme injustice in Iran and in many other countries around the world. However,
20120314-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20120314-11:27:22_3 Let me be clear European integration can indeed transform the politics and economics of candidate countries as it has done in my country, but it cannot construct democratic legitimacy of states and their institutions.
20101110-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20101110-20:00:29_2 In this respect, I am highly appreciative of Commissioner Barnier's strong commitment to take into account citizens' concerns and aspirations.
20101110-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20101110-20:00:29_6 In my opinion, the single market is not getting the political support urgently needed to ensure that it does not become yesterday's business.
20101110-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20101110-20:00:29_7 More political leadership on the single market from the Presidents of the Commission and Council would go a long way towards achieving a viable single market to serve as a catalyst for economic recovery.
20101110-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20101110-20:00:29_9 We must not lose this political momentum and this unique opportunity to revitalise the single market.
20101110-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20101110-20:00:29_10 I repeat that market integration is not an irreversible process and must not be taken for granted
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:32:20_11 There are no first class and second class countries.
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:32:20_6 But Schengen will not be completed until all members who want to be part of it have the chance to join.
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:32:20_4 They exist only on maps and in the heads of those who want to destroy the Union.

20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:32:20_9 In this situation, trying to politicise this debate with different issues is a huge mistake. First, because these three countries are not in the same situation, and second, because accession to Schengen cannot be mixed with the cooperation and verification mechanism.
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:32:20_10 The decision on accession to Schengen must be based on technical criteria, and a delay based on political reasons is simply unacceptable.
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:34:51_2 As was already said, it is difficult to imagine the European Union today without Schengen.
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:34:51_3 This is a very tangible expression of our solidarity and of the freedom and unity of European citizens, and it brings a lot of economic benefits but not for all Europeans.
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:34:51_6 First, it is about credibility if we as a Union follow our own rules.
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:34:51_8 Second, the economic benefits will bring benefits to all citizens of the European Union.
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:34:51_10 Instead of wasting money for internal controls, we should strengthen through resources and enough financing the external borders of the Union.
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:34:51_13 We often complain that anti European forces, populists, are using arguments against the European Union.
20171213-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171213-15:34:51_14 This is one of the cases, because it shows injustice to too many European citizens, and now the European Council has to do its job, which is not performed an injustice has to be stopped.
20180117-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180117-12:13:13_2 Are you aware that the United States, Switzerland and Germany, which are true and historic federations, do not have a single national constituency?
20180117-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180117-12:13:13_5 Are you aware that this will reinforce the weight of the big states because it is natural that in the first place on each list there will be nationals from the bigger states? This will jeopardise the position of Ireland and Portugal.
20171024-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171024-11:15:33_9 And this is, I guess, quite important.
20171024-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171024-11:07:45_0 Madam President, I have three messages one for all colleagues, one for President Tusk and the other for the Commission. I will be very sharp, very loud and very clear.
20171024-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171024-11:07:45_5 I am very worried about this idea of an extraordinary Council on the composition of the European Parliament. This is a competence and a power of our Parliament that then has to be approved by the Council, it is true, but we have made huge progress. I, as a professor of constitutional law
20171024-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171024-11:07:45_7 The Council should be aware of this in any case.
20140226-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20140226-18:14:37_4 For this reason, the European Union must pay close attention to the deteriorating human rights situation of the Iraqi Turkmen, not only because it is our duty but also because this situation is directly associated with stability in the wider Middle East region.
20140226-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20140226-18:14:37_2 The European Parliament resolution adopted on 14March2013 was a welcome step forward but was not enough given the current situation. Today, the cultural, religious and economic damage inflicted on the Turkmen population is still highly visible and cannot be ignored by the European Union. We should not forget all the incidents which took place in the cities of Tuz Khurmatu and Kirkuk,
20090916-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090916-17:14:13_2 pending conditions.
20170914-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20170914-15:01:20_3 Over many years the agency has demonstrated its capacity to provide education, health, relief, and social services.
20171004-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171004-11:32:31_6 The other is the European Defence Fund.
20171004-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171004-11:32:31_2 The European Union is known as a soft power and this identity should be preserved and developed.
20171004-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171004-11:32:31_7 I would like to stress that the intention to have more than EUR 5 billion per year for this fund requires own resources for the European Union.
20180314-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20180314-16:57:52_7 Corruption is not just a private matter. That's why we have to push governments and political and social bodies to fight, for themselves, against their internal, structural corruption.
20151028-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20151028-17:37:47_1 things are not in line with those high standards in some or many of our Member States we do not know how many.
20151028-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20151028-17:37:47_4 and it is really very difficult to reach a solution without knowing where this border is and what are the guarantees for the other side of the border, the national security area, so that we really can say to our citizens yes, we have the highest standards
20151028-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20151028-17:37:47_6 So I urge the Commission and Council to provide us with this kind of clear knowledge of what we mean by national security.
20150527-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150527-20:59:58_2 We should continue to invest our efforts in guaranteeing the implementation of the existing tools and the full use of the EU initiatives dedicated to the fight against cyber threats.
20150527-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150527-20:59:58_3 We should also continue and intensify work to provide for new and more comprehensive responses to the constantly evolving challenges posed by this threat.
20150527-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150527-20:59:58_4 The Council remains fully committed to work constructively towards the adoption and effective implementation of concrete measures in that respect.
20150527-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150527-20:59:58_6 Today the Presidency and the European Parliament received key input from the Commission on its recommendations for the most challenging issues in the directive, regarding its scope and several aspects of implementation, that will be instrumental in making the last remaining strides
20150527-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150527-20:59:58_8 With this directive the EU is going into unchartered territory in attempting to make our new digital lives more safe and secure.
20150527-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150527-20:59:58_9 This is, admittedly, not an easy process, as developing legislation on a highly technical issue that touches at the same time on national security is no easy task. The Latvian Presidency continues and will continue to work to make significant progress on this issue by the end of June.
20150527-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150527-20:59:58_12 We shall also continue our efforts towards introducing effective and creative practical, preventive and control measures that will go beyond the necessary legislative minimum.
20150527-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150527-20:59:58_14 Dramatic changes in the media landscape, in particular the introduction of new technologies, have resulted in an unprecedented flow of information.
20150527-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150527-20:59:58_15 Despite draconian measures, neither totalitarian regimes nor terrorists are able to firmly close the tap and fully prevent the information flow.
20150527-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150527-20:59:58_18 The media serve as a catalyst for a rapid and effective global response, and thus they are vital to the survival of a democratic society.
20130418-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20130418-11:45:08_0 Mr President, I would to like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs, because this negotiation procedure has not been the traditional I want this, you want that, let's meet in the middle'.

20130418-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20130418-11:45:08_5 There has been a massive lobbying campaign against this proposal by the ports, but it is actually based on incorrect information.

20090325-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090325-10:58:27_3 Free market theology must not stand in the way of doing right by workers.
20090325-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090325-10:58:27_6 So, is the common refrain that we must learn the lessons of this economic crisis genuine?
20090325-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090325-10:58:27_8 If it is, then the case for fundamental change in EU policy, and indeed EU Treaties, is now unanswerable and should be the stuff of EU Council deliberations.
20090325-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090325-10:58:27_11 We need a new treaty for a new time.
20130417-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20130417-21:14:12_4 So I call upon the Council to act according to legislation, according to democracy
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_0 Mr President, new technologies are rapidly changing the nature of the financial infrastructure around the globe.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_1 This presents massive opportunities for Europe and it is now up to us, the policymakers, to make the right choices and create a conducive environment so that Europe can benefit to the full extent.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_2 FinTech is often used to refer to a specific scenario of start—ups disrupting finance with innovation.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_3 This definition is not the one used in our report because it would exclude a large number of relevant actors.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_4 Instead FinTech may be understood as finance enabled by new technologies covering the whole range of financial services, products and infrastructure.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_5 It also includes InsureTech, the use of new technologies in insurance, and RegTech, the application of new technologies for regulatory compliance. The current rise of FinTech comes after the origination of a number of different technological developments within a short time span,
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_6 namely artificial intelligence, cloud computing and distributed ledger technology.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_7 These provide new opportunities for disruptions like mobile payments, open banking, crowdfunding, crypto currencies and robo advice.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_8 FinTech can lead to significant benefits such as cost reductions, efficiency gains, and more transparency.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_9 It can also be an effective tool for financial inclusion, opening up high—level services for those who could not afford them before.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_10 Furthermore, FinTech can enable cross—border financial flows and infrastructure through alternative lending and investment channels.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_11 The FinTech revolution that we are currently experiencing is global.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_13 The bulk of these investments was made in the United States, and Asia and Israel are also gearing up in this respect.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_14 The US, China and Israel host more than half of the top ten largest FinTech companies.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_15 If Europe wants to remain competitive, rapid innovation should be the norm, not the exception.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_16 This is not only important for Europe's financial infrastructure, but also for the real economy, with consumers and businesses benefiting from improved financial services.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_17 Notwithstanding all the benefits, FinTech also confronts us with essential questions of a regulatory, societal nature.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_18 Consumer protection and the stability of the financial system should be key concerns in this regard.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_19 Together with the competitiveness of the European economy, they make for the core priorities of this report.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_20 The report does not intend to give technical solutions.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_21 However, it does intend to pose the right questions.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_22 That should be a first step in the process of creating a forward—looking European policy in the area of financial technologies.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_23 The intention of this report is not to propose specific legislative actions.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_24 We must be cautious with creating new rules because much is still unclear about future developments of financial technologies.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_25 A better point of departure is investigating where current legislation causes uncertainties or barriers and identifying where additional action is necessary.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_26 Doing this purposefully requires a holistic approach, as technological developments in our digitising society call for breaking silos.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_27 FinTech actors are already breaking silos themselves.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_28 They often offer products in a diverse multi party conjunction.
20170516-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170516-22:11:57_29 I have some minutes left at the end and will use the time then.
20141126-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141126-21:49:15_6 In order to go on with any kind of digital services, we have to have very strong common, simple and understandable data protection regulations.
20141126-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141126-21:49:15_7 I very much hope that, in cooperation with the Commission and Parliament, we can make it clear to the Council that the package of data protection is crucial for the development of the Digital Single Market.
20170406-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170406-09:41:23_3 The Roma people have been suffering all through European history but the situation has never been better.
20170406-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170406-09:41:23_5 Today, we have an opportunity to give prosperity to all of the people of Europe.
20170406-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170406-09:41:23_6 Please address that in your reply and do not continue to attack the people that are moving across borders.
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_16 In addition, with the implementation of a harmonised European approach, making these websites accessible also has the potential to be a highly profitable business.
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_10 The directive now covers all EU public sector bodies' websites and websites providing public services, as now laid down in a new annex.
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_14 This directive is essentially a forerunner in the planned European Accessibility Act, which I know is also being eagerly awaited by our citizens.
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_12 The specifications for accessibility are technology neutral and based on the international Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_23 In our increasingly digital world, accessibility is very much a human right. All people are entitled to use the internet in order to exercise their fundamental rights.
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_6 Less than one third of Europe's public sector and government websites, and even less than 10 of Europe's websites in general, are fully accessible.
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_4 However, despite the fact that assistive technology already exists, Europe has been lagging far behind.

20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_5 We are the European Union. We should be setting the agenda, not struggling, or even failing, to keep up.
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_7 Making websites and their content useable for all should already have become a priority at EU level.
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_1 This piece of legislation is long overdue and eagerly awaited both by citizens with disabilities and by our increasingly ageing population who find themselves more and more isolated and excluded from a world where information is accessible primarily online.
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_9 The IMCO Committee was more ambitious, and made a number of significant amendments to the text.
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_22 I am sure the Greek Presidency will follow up the good work on this file and it is completely feasible that the Italian Presidency will be able to bring this dossier into legislation.
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_15 The scope, along with the enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems, reflects the binding obligations set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the commitments made in the digital agenda for Europe.
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_17 The financial benefits are currently estimated at EUR2 billion.
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_20 However, I thank Commissioner Kroes for having openly supported our legislative work using one of the most modern ways of rapid communication, Twitter.
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-21:49:57_19 However, this is only the first step in the legislative process. We regret the lack of engagement by previous presidencies on this dossier.
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-22:25:56_1 This is both an ethical issue and a commercial issue.
20140225-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140225-22:25:56_2 It is about basic and fundamental human rights and it is about jobs.
20151215-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151215-22:31:33_2 In the speech you said that, after a year of work in another country, the country in which the frontier worker had worked should be financially responsible for the payment of unemployment benefits.
20151215-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151215-22:31:33_3 The guiding principle behind this is that a frontier worker should receive benefits from the country in which he or she has contributed.
20151215-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151215-22:31:33_4 This is fair for everybody, you said.
20151215-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151215-22:31:33_5 I completely agree with this principle. Therefore, Commissioner, I would like to ask you tonight if you think that this principle that a person should receive benefits from the country in which he or she has contributed should apply not only to frontier workers, but to all mobile workers within the EU.
20160510-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20160510-10:53:57_0 You mentioned that there are differences between the countries in youth unemployment. You mentioned Spain and Greece, for example.
20180205-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180205-19:21:11_3 The aim is to undermine the work of legislators such as us, and at the same time mislead consumers.
20180205-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180205-19:21:11_9 This is leaving millions of fraudulent cars on our roads, more than two years after the dieselgate' scandal and our committee work in this Parliament!
20180205-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180205-19:21:11_10 In our economy, Commissioner, and in our society, no private company, no sector they may be the largest, they may have a lot of people working there but none of them should be allowed to act as they do today, as the car industry does today, because then they think they are
20170705-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20170705-09:40:38_1 Suppose we were to follow your order and receive migrants and refugees in my country, Hungary. You, as well as every single person in this room, know perfectly well that those people would not want to stay in Hungary because they want a better life.
20170705-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20170705-09:40:38_4 What is the order, so to say, in this respect?
20170705-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20170705-09:40:38_5 We all know very well that we cannot put these people into a closed institution
20170705-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20170705-09:40:38_6 they have the right to freedom of movement.
20170705-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20170705-09:40:38_7 I know we should integrate them.
20170705-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20170705-09:40:38_8 This will probably be the answer, but this is the wrong answer, Mr Timmermans and dear colleagues, because they would not like to be integrated in Hungary, they would like to move on the next day to richer countries. So you must have a strategy on that, because your whole strategy about the treatment of the migrant crisis
20170704-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20170704-22:07:26_5 We are in a position to pressure the Cuban government more to open up.
20170613-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170613-15:26:44_1 Implementation and enforcement are fundamental for our future.
20170613-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170613-15:26:44_2 A good application of EU law is basic in order to regain the support of our citizens and increase the efficiency of our monetary union.
20170613-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170613-15:26:44_8 We need to ensure this before talking about more integration.
20120314-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20120314-10:43:29_1 The 2011 enlargement report on Iceland clearly demonstrates Iceland's advanced level of preparation. The closure of eight negotiation chapters is most welcome, but the challenging negotiations are yet to come, and I mean here chapters such as fisheries and agriculture, which will need special attention given that circumstances in Iceland are different from those of other European countries.

20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_2 The legislator defined both mandatory information and voluntary information for consumers, making information a crucial point of the legislation.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_4 It is critical that consumers have access to complete information in order to make an informed choice.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_6 The resolution of the Committee on Fisheries discusses the Commission survey for control of 2015, which analyses the conformity of labelling with the legal requirements of white fish in retail.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_8 However, numbers are worrying for some species, for which the level of conformity is very low common species are substituted for more expensive species.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_22 It could help in the creation of an external structure which scrutinises the certification of voluntary claims included on the label of fishery and aquaculture products.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_24 I would also like to remind the Commission that Parliament is still awaiting the Commission report on the possibility to define and establish minimum criteria for the creation of an EU ecolabel for fishery and aquaculture products.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_15 Further information on fish can be added to a label as an addition to compulsory information.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_13 Member States must implement sanctions which are efficient, proportionate and dissuasive.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_11 Compulsory and correct information must be available for consumers all the way through the chain, including diners in restaurants.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_20 It deals with voluntary information on fishery products and aims at creating an up—to—date and exhaustive inventory of voluntary claims associated with fishery and aquaculture products, which are marketed in the European Union, whatever their origin.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_19 The Commission is currently working on the implementation of a pilot project proposed by Parliament last year and my regards to our chair, Mr Cadec, who could not be here today.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_21 This inventory will enable an analysis of the certification systems of these claims.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_18 It is also necessary that such information be reliable, meaning it must be controlled in a very strict manner.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_16 This information can enable consumers to have complementary information such as the date of catch, date of landing, more information on fishing gear, the flag state, information on the nutritional value of the product or environmental, ethical or social information.

20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_14 First and foremost, Member States have to reinforce controls in order to identify fraud and the missing links in the supply chain for fishery and aquaculture products which lead to mislabelling or fraud.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_12 It is the duty of Member States to guarantee that this information is available and accurate.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_23 We are awaiting this external structure and hope that this information will be easily accessible to consumers.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_25 The publication of this report is a requirement of the common market organisation for fishery and aquaculture regulation.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_9 This is often the case for bluefin tuna.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_3 Compulsory information is the following the commercial designation of a species and its scientific name, the production method and fishing gear, the area where the product was caught or produced and a clear indication whether the product was defrosted. This mandatory information applies to both retail and supply for caterers and restaurants.
20160509-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160509-20:53:00_5 Restaurants must always keep the information which they received when they bought the product in case consumers or state authorities ask for them.
20090203-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090203-09:54:38_4 We need to promote public awareness and online safety, especially among children, but also among parents so that they know exactly what is going on and what can be done on the Internet.
20090203-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090203-09:54:38_2 a wonderful source of information for all of us and something that will be part of our lives into the future. However, there are those who prey on children and they will use the Internet as much as they possibly can to try to undermine children.
20090203-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090203-09:54:38_5 I think Member States should work together to introduce a network of contact points for the public to reach in order to report illegal and harmful content and conduct.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20090324-17:45:27_4 If I could turn to activity based budgeting and management, I think the Commission has made huge progress on this but I would warn against over bureaucratising this exercise because what we want to ensure is a qualitative evaluation, not simply ticking boxes.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20090324-17:45:27_8 This would allow us to get a much clearer idea of our policy perspectives on top of the Commission's annual work programmes.

20090324-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20090324-17:45:27_1 Is it flexible enough to reflect changing times?
20090324-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20090324-17:45:27_5 We do not want people spending all their time evaluating themselves when they should be getting on and doing some work.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20090324-17:45:27_3 Too much is left in the budget because we cannot change things because of the restrictions of the MFF.
20170426-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170426-16:44:25_4 Now it is about a university, it is about NGOs, it is, above all, about the next national consultation.
20170426-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170426-16:44:25_2 We have witnessed an attempt or rather a vague idea to reintroduce the death penalty, and all that coming from a man who is constantly referring to Christian values.
20170426-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170426-16:44:25_6 Now the only thing that comes to my mind in this context is if all foreign influence is so bad, why do you accept the payment of EUR 5 billion euros annually as a big net recipient of European structural funds in order to plaster the whole country with the posters in which you called Brussels crap?
20170426-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170426-16:44:25_7 Somebody who does that, Prime Minister, leaves the Union out of their own accord.
20170426-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170426-16:44:25_1 We have witnessed several unspeakably worded national consultations in the meantime.
20170426-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170426-16:44:25_5 The NGO thing, Prime Minister, is not about transparency as we all know it is in order to label NGOs that are foreign funded as foreign', because they might carry foreign influence in Hungary, and foreign influence is bad.
20170426-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170426-16:44:25_3 It escapes me, Prime Minister, where the death penalty would be on any Christian agenda, and I have rarely found any Christian theologian who would have been able to find anything good about the death penalty.
20131210-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20131210-16:02:42_3 When was the last time one million people marched through the streets of a European capital demanding more EU integration?
20131210-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20131210-16:02:42_4 It is also a moment of truth for our policy in the eastern neighbourhood and, I would dare to say, the biggest test yet of the EU's performance as a geopolitical player capable of defending its interests and values in the immediate neighbourhood.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_28 May. I fully share the Parliament's sense of urgency to make progress on this proposal.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_11 I therefore welcome the proposal of the Committee on Budgets of the European Parliament which proposes to restore most of the appropriations proposed by the Commission in the draft budget.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_17 2015. We cannot afford to have the EU budget paralysed. We need to bring it under control and we have at this moment a unique opportunity to do so.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_20 I fully agree that we must act responsibly and address at this stage the needs that we have in payments.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_13 However, even if further reinforcement contributes to increasing investments, we should try and find the right balance with the implementation prospects and the payments availability.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_31 We should seize such an opportunity to address the shortage of payment appropriations
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_4 All this has to be achieved within very tight financial circumstances and very tight budgetary ceilings.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_3 We must also honour our obligations and pay outstanding bills stemming from past commitments, thus avoiding an unnecessary burden on beneficiaries.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_7 Sustainable economic growth, competitiveness, the creation of jobs and the fight against youth unemployment are other urgent priorities of the EU policy and should be reflected in the orientation of EU expenditure for 2015. We must do this under a clear and agreed framework and provide the necessary predictability and security for our investments and our partners.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_1 We must put all our efforts into making this framework fully operational, fully respecting all the terms of this agreement.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_9 2015. Last month I expressed before this House the Commission's concern about the position taken by the Council in its reading of the 2015 Budget.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_30 Exceptional additional revenue from fines stemming from the enforcement of competition policy means that the additional payment requests for 2014 will be, in total, at no cost for Member States.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_14 The level of payment appropriations remains the paramount concern that we need to address at this budget conciliation. We must ensure that the legal obligations arising in 2015 are met, and put a stop to the snowball effect of shifting an ever increasing amount of unpaid bills into future years.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_25 too. We must avoid artificial under budgeting in future as we are now all aware of the problems that such an approach brings.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_23 The reinforcement of payment appropriations proposed by the Commissionʼs amending letter No 1 go in the same direction as a number of amendments proposed by Parliament where the needs are most pressing, and in particular with the aim of reducing the backlog of unpaid bills and allowing the proper launching of the new programmes.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_18 In its draft budget, the Commission has proposed using the full amount of payment appropriations under the MFF ceiling for
20141021-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141021-19:07:19_29 As you know, favourable developments on the revenue side in 2014 provide an opportunity to find agreement in this direction.
20180312-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180312-22:30:11_11 I have in mind, for example, the EU Covenant of Mayors, which has been contributing to our climate and energy objectives since
20180312-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180312-22:30:11_2 This is, indeed, where regions and cities should be when it comes to finding solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation. They have proved to be ambitious, forward looking and innovative, so we need all of them on board.
20180312-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180312-22:30:11_9 There will be no place for business as usual'.
20180312-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180312-22:30:11_18 I think it is very important.
20170202-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20170202-11:11:26_0 Mr President, adoption is a wonderful alternative for otherwise unwanted children, or a child that's left in an unsafe environment.
20170202-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20170202-11:11:26_1 But what concerns me about this report is that it's another power grab by Brussels over the jurisdiction of family law.
20170202-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20170202-11:11:26_2 In the UK, there are strict laws about family courts, including the privacy of proceedings for what is and always will be a very emotive subject.
20170202-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20170202-11:11:26_3 But what I fear, with this latest demand for more Europe', is that the best interests of the child may be put second to the EU's desire for more and more power.
20170202-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20170202-11:11:26_4 And what happens if it is a disputed adoption?
20170202-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20170202-11:11:26_5 If the grandparents want to adopt?
20170202-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20170202-11:11:26_6 Or one parent is actually fighting the case?
20170202-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20170202-11:11:26_7 How will that work if the child is taken across another country's border, into another culture, or maybe where the child will be brought up speaking a different language?
20170202-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20170202-11:11:26_8 I believe that we all should be encouraging families to be strong and cohesive units, which is the best environment for bringing up a child, surely.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-19:52:40_9 We seriously disagree with that. Just witness the political meddling in the Brexit process or a number of European general elections, so indeed this is not just an issue for the east to consider, and this is not an issue for NATO's eastern flank. This is a larger concern to that we need to deal with. The second and, probably much more important, point
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-19:52:40_7 The report makes reference and emphasises, rightly, the security, defence and political challenge that Russia poses for the European Union.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-19:52:40_14 Much as I would like to avoid this, we cannot simply support this file as it stands now.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-19:52:40_12 This is an obligation for a bilateral, individual response between Member States.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-19:52:40_15 Thank you very much.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-19:52:40_11 I don't think I need to remind my honourable colleagues that this particular article is not traditionally understood as an obligation for collective response.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_21 but they will do so only when Ukrainians manage to fulfil all the agreed and outstanding conditions.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_18 I believe that our common goal is to help Ukraine, but it is true that we need to closely follow the situation.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_16 A step in the right direction is the adoption of the law on the high anti corruption court this last week.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_4 2014. This time, the Commission proposes EUR 1 billion to be dispersed as medium and long term loans.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_10 Third, the reform process, which has been important but is not really steady until now.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_14 Therefore, it is crucial that the two unfulfilled anti corruption measures will be part of the new conditions.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_6 This Memorandum sets out the supporting policy measures which are conditional for the disbursements of the funds.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_12 That being said, to address any doubts that may arise during this debate, the MFA is not an unconditional support.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_8 First, the worsening conflict and casualties in the east of Ukraine and all the many socio economic consequences of this aggression.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_9 Second, the economic recovery, which remains fragile.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_15 If corruption is not addressed drastically, MFA funds should not be delivered to Ukraine.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_7 In that context, I would like to highlight three key elements.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_13 There are firm conditions to ensure that this money will serve economic stabilisation and support the reforms. It is very important to remind that the Commission cancelled the last tranche of the third MFA programme when some of Ukraine's commitments were not fulfilled.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_17 In addition, the newly adopted law was signed yesterday by the President of Ukraine. The rapporteur welcomes this news with great satisfaction it means that Ukrainians take the commitment seriously.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_5 The assistance is also intended to trigger reforms in Ukraine, which is done by agreeing with the Ukrainian authorities a Memorandum of Understanding.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_11 Hence, the need for support for these reforms in the context where many interests can play against, especially in pre election years.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_3 In other words, it is a financial instrument and its purpose is economic stabilisation. This is the fourth time that the Commission proposes macrofinancial assistance for Ukraine since the beginning of the war in
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_19 If we are serious about our goal, we cannot slow down the procedures.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:54:28_1 I am very grateful that we are where we are now. Indeed, Ukraine needs this support and it deserves this support, and it is very appropriate to have this next programme now.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:54:28_7 I am grateful to the Commissioner that you although it is not included in the joint declaration explicitly referred to that, because that is what it is also about.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:54:28_8 We need to be very clear in this regard.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-21:23:51_2 However, the eternally crucial issue remains that of the implementation.
20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_0 Mr President, you can't save your money and spend it, you can't have you cake and eat it, and you can't pretend to be a nation when you are not.
20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_5 The European Union, despite what it likes to think, is not a nation.
20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_6 It follows that it cannot be and should not be a party to such international agreements, this one and many others.
20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_8 Happily, we have the perfect opportunity to play it and play it repeatedly.
20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_9 We, the United Kingdom, are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. We must not give this up. On the contrary, we must start to make better use of it.
20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_10 This means using it to oppose, block and even veto behaviour on international treaties, conventions and agreements which are against our interest. There is a clear UK message here for the European Union do you think you hold all the cards?
20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_11 You don't.
20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_12 Our hand is potentially a lot better than you understand.
20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_13 What the UK has to do, however, is to understand itself how good our hand is and then be prepared to use it.
20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_14 If the British Government is worth anything at all, those who play hardball with us should and, I hope, will find that we can play hardball with them.
20151027-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151027-21:00:53_1 It could form the blueprint for radical change without decreasing the funding going to newer Member States. I have called on the UK Government to include these Open Europe proposals in its reform and renegotiation discussions. After all, we are talking about a third of the EU's total budget.
20151027-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151027-21:03:25_0 That is quite difficult to explain briefly, but it is about not shuffling money around from one country to another, and not particularly that large scale recipient countries give money to the Commission that the Commission then gives them back and tells them what to do.
20151027-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151027-21:03:25_1 Rather, it is focusing on countries like yours, in situations like yours, so that cohesion achieves sustainable economic growth and lifts people out of that situation for the benefit of everybody within the EU on a limited basis, not forever.
20171025-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171025-09:28:48_14 It will be an unnecessary collection of much information about travellers who are completely innocent.
20171025-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171025-09:28:48_16 They have to delete the data after the exit, unless there is a risk or a suspicion. What we expect from the Canadian authorities with regard to our citizens, we should also respect with regard to citizens of third—countries like Canada.
20171025-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171025-09:28:48_7 We are not fixing the system, which is not working because some of the Member States' authorities are not thoroughly working with the system and feeding information into it.
20171025-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171025-09:28:48_2 We have to check their passports, and that is exactly what we are doing.
20171025-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171025-09:28:48_11 But with this system you do not keep track of any visa over stayer in the European Union.
20170913-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170913-11:57:04_3 Stop bashing Hungary, stop preaching to us about solidarity, and talk about solidarity to those strong, healthy, young Syrian and other men who should go home and rebuild their countries.
20170913-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170913-11:27:02_1 But, at the same time, you know that people are tired of words and promises and it is time for action from the Commission as well. The strongest tool which you possess as a Commission is the draft of your budget for the next multiannual financial framework. We should stop thinking about how to reduce the European budget
20170913-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170913-11:27:02_2 but look for own resources.
20170913-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170913-11:27:02_3 We should really focus on political priorities and the major priority is how to move from a Europe of divergence and inequalities towards a Europe of convergence, strong economic growth and social justice.
20170913-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170913-11:45:22_1 This means that life for people in Europe is better and that is what people expect from
20170913-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170913-11:45:22_4 I agree and I appreciate
20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_13 In some cases a certificate of legality will only be a starting point, the first measure included in the due diligence procedure.
20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_11 Firstly I would like to refer to the due diligence approach, which is more comprehensive than just a certificate of legality.
20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_14 Where the risk assessment has shown that the country of origin presents a higher risk of administrative corruption, or in countries where enforcement of national laws is weak, additional guarantees are necessary to underpin the certified legality.
20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_12 The principle of due diligence reflects the legal obligation of a proactive behaviour to a certain legality and needs to be demonstrated on a basis of comprehensive measures which will enable legality to be reasonably assured.
20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_3 We should keep in mind that patterns of tropical deforestation are the result of the interaction of a number of different factors which vary in importance in different locations.
20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_5 In the European Union we understand that working on the coherence of our policies must go hand in hand with supporting countries in their efforts to strengthen national and local institutions and make progress towards effective governance and use of forest resources. I wish to thank again
20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_7 I am encouraged that Parliament, while endorsing the approach of the Commission, wants to reinforce it further and has made amendments to this end.
20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_9 I also want to assure you that the Commission will give careful consideration to the amendments of the proposed regulation.
20131022-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20131022-21:57:50_7 this is what they need.
20171113-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171113-22:43:46_15 Moreover, we will investigate any barriers that may prevent consumers from switching to better offers.
20171113-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171113-22:43:46_2 We also think that a single market for retail financial services which can rely on innovative solutions is very welcome.
20180208-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180208-15:06:14_15 A high level of environmental protection is, of course, of the highest priority for the Commission.
20111212-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20111212-21:57:22_2 The developing countries have delivered. We asked them for a road map for a legally binding global agreement.
20091215-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20091215-17:52:17_6 I think that when it comes to such sensitive topics, we cannot afford to classify them into strict categories such as EU internal and EU external issues, because terrorist actions might be planned outside the EU but can seriously affect the people living inside the EU.
20171213-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171213-18:39:23_12 They are in your portfolio no poverty, reducing inequality, decent work.
20171213-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171213-18:39:23_14 Let me conclude.
20171213-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171213-18:39:23_1 It is a sine qua non for the future of our planet and for the future of our people.
20171213-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171213-18:39:23_9 You could say that, in times of fake news, it is good to have data.
20171213-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171213-18:39:23_2 Therefore, reaching the sustainable development goals within the EU is vital.
20171213-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171213-18:39:23_6 It says that we are making progress and we are moving in the right direction.
20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_0 Mr President, the International Energy Agency just recently published a report saying that the developed countries of this world, the industrialised countries, have about five years to change fundamentally the way they produce energy and the way they consume energy
20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_1 in order for us to stay below a two degree increase in temperature.
20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_2 Now, if we do not stay below two degrees, we know what will happen.
20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_4 Then, if we look at what has actually now been pledged by the same countries, the countries that need to change fundamentally within five years, it is unfortunately very unsatisfactory.
20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_5 We see a situation now where the pledges are about half of what we need in order to reach our target.
20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_8 We all know that we will not get a full legally binding agreement with regard to mitigation in Durban that will solve these problems, but we know also that we have possibilities to pursue targets that are ambitious nonetheless targets that will get us closer to our final goal.
20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_13 This is why we have a moral obligation to help them financially
20110215-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20110215-09:31:28_2 The fact that it is colder here now is also quite predictable, because if the Gulf Stream is pressed down by meltwater from the Arctic, this is an explainable effect.
20180614-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20180614-12:26:45_1 It has to do with a very important argument on democracy.
20180614-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20180614-12:20:00_2 Cabotage caused problems inside Member States in national transport.
20180614-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20180614-12:20:00_3 Now, we are limiting it to two days per Member State and it will be posting from day one. Nomadic driving drivers have a new right to go back home by the end of a maximum of three weeks.
20180614-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20180614-12:20:00_4 We are ending driver misuse and letter box companies.
20180614-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20180614-12:20:00_5 For the first time, common strong enforcement is possible by using the latest technology available. If the national transport is posting from day one, colleagues voting against can go back home and tell drivers that in the future they might not drive for their national salaries anymore. Instead, they could be
20180614-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20180614-12:20:00_6 paid a final country destination minimum wage.
20180614-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20180614-12:20:00_7 This is a two—way street.
20180614-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20180614-12:20:00_8 You need to understand what it means for the universally applicable collective agreements if you oppose the mandate.
20180614-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20180614-12:20:00_9 Minimum wages might become the new norm and you should all be aware of that.
20180614-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20180614-12:20:00_10 Currently, we do not have a common EU minimum wage level in transport and the posting of the Drivers Directive is not the right tool to do that.
20180614-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20180614-12:20:00_11 That is totally another discussion.
20111116-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20111116-17:47:42_1 We need a rich content of information and to facilitate access to information which could improve our lives and lead to concrete economic growth.
20170614-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20170614-19:03:45_2 First, we should have a better guarantee and a better look at the additionality.
20170614-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20170614-19:03:45_5 There we have to support these countries so they have a better capacity to take it up, quality to make projects and investment banks, as my colleague has said.
20180614-0900-PLENARY-en_20180614-12:26:45_1 It has to do with a very important argument on democracy.
20180614-0900-PLENARY-en_20180614-10:46:02_5 Oleg Sentsov's case is no longer just a judicial or political one.
20180614-0900-PLENARY-en_20180614-10:46:02_8 He should be immediately and unconditionally released on humanitarian grounds.
20180614-0900-PLENARY-en_20180614-10:46:02_6 It is now a matter of human compassion.
20180614-0900-PLENARY-en_20180614-12:20:00_2 Cabotage caused problems inside Member States in national transport.
20180614-0900-PLENARY-en_20180614-12:20:00_3 Now, we are limiting it to two days per Member State and it will be posting from day one.

20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-16:34:02_5 Daphne Galizia was known internationally, was known globally for her fight against corruption. She reported on the corruption.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-16:34:02_3 Malta is geographically and historically one of the gates and one of the doors of the European Union.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-16:34:02_6 She reported on the Panama Papers and we have seen, we have read, we have heard and we could not ignore that the Panama Papers are directly implicated with some Maltese authorities.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-16:34:02_4 It should be the bastion of the protection of human rights, the rule of law, the independence of judicial power and impartially of criminal prosecution.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-16:34:02_2 the Commission and the Maltese authorities to do is to grant respect and observation of the rule of law.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-15:47:14_4 But a similar concern and wish for dialogue in relation to Spain is not shown by the European Union institutions, in spite of having there more than strong signals of breaches of the rule of law, of democracy and of fundamental rights.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-15:47:14_1 Point 5 expresses concerns about the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights, including freedom of the media, independence of the police and judiciary.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-15:47:14_7 half of this government is in prison, the other half in exile
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-15:10:37_1 I am ashamed, and we all should be ashamed because without this killing we would never have known here what happens in Malta journalists being harassed, denounced and even killed, media houses being blackmailed by banks suspected of money laundering and tax evasion,
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-15:10:37_2 high government officials suspected of being implicated also in the same operations, and police authorities refusing to investigate those allegations because they have been appointed by and have economic and personal ties with the government.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-15:10:37_3 We cannot remain silent, so today we ask for three concrete actions. First, we want the Commission to immediately launch a rule of law dialogue with Malta.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-15:10:37_4 Second, we want the Maltese authorities to investigate and to prosecute money laundering, no matter the names or the organisations implicated.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-15:10:37_5 Thirdly, we want an independent and international investigation into the killing of Daphne Caruana Galizia. We have to say, loud and clear, that Europe's values and principles are much more important than money.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-15:10:37_7 Europe is about justice, about separation of powers and about the rule of law.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-15:10:37_8 Everybody knows that.
20171114-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171114-15:10:37_9 But Europe is also about freedom, transparency and truth.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-11:24:15_33 The legislation to implement PNR has been submitted to our Parliament and is being discussed in our House.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-11:24:15_43 States. Taxation is a key element of the political systems in our democracies, and in the Treaty they are therefore part and I believe rightly so of the Member States' competencies.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-11:24:15_4 I was very happy that you made this point and we have to work on that.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-11:24:15_74 fully agree. I did not mention it in my speech, but the same pay for the same work in the same type of circumstances is at the core of the belief of the Dutch Government, and we will push
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-11:24:15_19 There can be no doubt, and I am happy that I know that the whole Commission is behind it.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-11:24:15_80 will rise. Maybe not for you personally, but this is happening at
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-11:24:15_50 reform. Yes, we are working on new alliances within
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-11:24:15_72 free market. Thanks to the free market, hundreds of millions of people in the last ten to fifteen years have been lifted out of poverty
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-11:24:15_49 we are. We are pushing for radical
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-11:24:15_14 For our defence, it is crucial to keep the dialogue with the United States going, even if within that family relationship we have some serious quarrels at the moment.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-11:24:15_68 help. We have to do this collectively.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-11:24:15_60 they agree. In many cases, as we all know, they very much disagree, and that also helps the debate in those
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-11:24:15_66 it to me. You have this big
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:43:11_20 Dutch union and I am absolutely convinced that, in those days, she would have fully agreed with what I have just
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:43:11_9 Secondly, on migration here today I reach out my hand to Italy because I know that they have to deal with an extremely difficult situation.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:43:11_1 Thank you all for participating in this debate.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:43:11_7 I am absolutely convinced that we cannot just say there are new tasks which have to be funded and, at the same time, we cannot find savings in the existing budget. That is the plea I am making here. That is exactly what all the Member States have to do. I believe that simply saying we have to go
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:43:11_3 There were so many questions, I cannot answer all of them but I have tried to bring them back to basically four key issues.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:43:11_12 This is also my answer to Mr Bashir on this issue better guarding of our borders and working on better return mechanisms for rejected asylum seekers.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:43:11_10 But I also eagerly await the Italian Government's national measures because they have to do a lot in order to manage the inflow of illegal migrants better, and then they know that we stand ready to show solidarity and, as the European Union, to work collectively to address this issue, which no doubt will be with us for years to come.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:43:11_18 Europe. I believe that social affairs have to stay at a national level, but when social affairs have a cross border impact then Europe also needs to get involved.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:43:11_27 level. We also have to remain focused and this is crucial on structural
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:41:41_4 It's about time that the Council fingers point not at those who act like the new government in Spain but at those who do not act.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:41:41_5 Number two the question cannot be externalised and the answer cannot be simply repressive.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:41:41_6 It has to be holistic and preventive.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:40:08_1 But then you have to explain to us how this is compatible this giant external European Union with an internal dwarf European Union.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:40:08_4 This is not sustainable.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:40:08_6 And let me put a final question do you really believe that one per cent of the budget, one per cent of GDP, is the fast track the big way for the big government of the European institutions?
20180613-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20180613-12:40:08_8 Please, be reasonable.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090309-20:05:45_1 About 80 of all new jobs in the European Union have been created by SMEs, and in my own constituency of Dublin about 400 people are employed by about 100 companies in the SME sector.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090309-20:05:45_13 The challenge that we have at the moment is about jobs, jobs, jobs, and we must bend over backwards to try and protect existing employment and, hopefully, in the years ahead try and create new jobs.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090309-20:05:45_14 That is absolutely essential for all of us.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090309-20:05:45_12 If we want to get our small businesses and employment to stabilise in the European Union and in each individual Member State, we must do everything we possibly can to try and save them.
20090309-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090309-20:05:45_2 We must do all we possibly can at the moment to support these companies in difficult times.
20171212-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20171212-23:01:40_8 The sectors most affected are mining, extractive industries, agri—business, hydroelectric dams and water rights and logging.
20171212-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20171212-23:01:40_4 2015. In 2016, there were around four murders per week and this murderous trend went on this year.
20171212-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20171212-23:01:40_9 The EU and its Member States are clearly not doing enough to ensure corporate accountability and legal redress.
20171212-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20171212-23:01:40_1 This annual report includes strong language on the shrinking space for civil society, including the call for an EU monitoring mechanism for cases of violations of freedom of assembly and association.
20171212-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20171212-23:01:40_7 Environmental human rights defenders like her are under threat when they oppose the interests of corporations and governments.
20160525-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20160525-23:06:06_1 Hungary, where one can witness cronyism at its finest, is a perfect example to demonstrate this problem.
20180531-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20180531-10:29:07_5 First, introduction of targeted measures against individuals responsible for grave human rights violations, and second, providing active support for civil society groups and defenders of human rights. I would like here to extend our sympathy and support for the Iranian people who have, since the end of last year,
20131022-0900-PLENARY-8-en_20131022-12:41:24_1 This is coming back to us after successful conclusion of the negotiations, and I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, and also the Commission for its assistance in facilitating this deal, which actually places demands on facilities so that the practice known as beaching' is not possible any more, and that is a great step forward.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_5 When you look at the situation in Greece, it is difficult.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_35 Of course, a lot of the things in that agreement between the Union and the Member States and Turkey have to be dealt with and elaborated on and those individual aspects will of course, when it is legally bound to be dealt with by the proper institutions.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_24 The border will not be opening again.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_37 We need to work at full speed on a European border guard system, on a revision of Dublin and on more structural European solutions.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_1 It is not the solution. It is an outline of possible solutions and it is the beginning of the implementation and hard work that has been done and has to be done.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_31 You cannot survive being at sea so you have to engage with the country on the other side and you have to engage with countries on the other side of the external borders. So agreement with Turkey would have been necessary in any case.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_6 There are a lot of things to be built up from scratch.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_14 So we are seeing improvements, we are seeing positive effects already, but we also realise that a lot has to be done.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_12 The Greek Government is also doing what it can to help, and Member States are supporting it.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_8 Part of the way it dealt with it before was by NGOs supplying the food.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_23 But one thing has to be clear their only solution is to apply for asylum in Greece, get into that system and offer themselves up for relocation.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_34 But in our position it is not an agreement within the legal meaning of Article 218 of the Treaty.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-08:34:44_8 It offers us new challenges that are more manageable than the old ones that we had to face last year, but they are still challenges, and they still lead to a lot of work and a lot of improvement that we are doing on a day—by day, week by week basis.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-08:34:44_22 It is quite clear that they have a right to be heard, they have a right to a procedure and they have a right to an appeal. They are processed regularly.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-08:34:44_11 That has happened and a lot of work has to be done in practice to improve the plight of the people in the reception facilities and also to get this new system of readmission started.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-08:34:44_2 We are also combining this with getting more of a grip on who is coming to the European Member States for protection and who is being offered protection in the region and in Turkey.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-08:34:44_26 be very aware that there is a risk of other routes and that we have to work hard to find solutions to prevent those routes from leading to a large influx, posing Member States with a lot of issues and to put it most horribly having the refugees and the migrants, whether regular or not, putting their lives at great risk
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-08:34:44_20 We also commend the hard work being done on the Turkish side to improve the situation of the refugees they harbour they harbour millions there so it is a lot of work and also the legal safeguards and the legal position of those people has been improved by Turkey, which helps us enormously in making this agreement work and having a better solution than we had before.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-08:34:44_19 So we are seeing improvements every day, but we fully realise, as Member States and as the Council, that we are not there yet and a lot has to be done.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-08:34:44_5 I think that is the biggest benefit we can already see from this agreement.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-08:34:44_12 Of course other Member States have to do a lot as well.
20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-08:34:44_7 Let me say from the Council perspective and the Member States' perspective that this is not a perfect solution, but it is the best solution that we can find right now.
20171003-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171003-11:25:07_4 Unfortunately, for the time being, it seems to me that we are not on the way to reducing this uncertainty.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_4 Brexit is an unfortunate reality, but we have to move on.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_24 We I think I should rephrase that most of us believe in a future Europe that upholds the fundamental value of solidarity on issues like migration, and in a Europe that strives to guarantee the safety and security of its citizens.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_22 We must use as a basic platform the established principles respect for human rights and dignity, freedom, equality and rule of law.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_31 Any progress registered on the future of Europe must be followed up and translated into action.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_33 Having spent almost nine years myself in this institution, I know how crucial and meaningful Parliament's continuous role and participation is in this defining moment for the future shaping of the European project. Colleagues, we need to draw on this momentum and galvanise and energise our forces to forge a stronger, better Union.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_35 We believe that success belongs to those who can harness positive forces that unite rather than divide.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_26 Current indicators show that we have, once again, started to register successes. We believe that the Union should be should be robustly positioned to shape and manage better globalisation, not merely react to it.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_20 This could pave the way for the eventual erosion of unity.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_27 A strong Europe is needed to bring about the right balance in a world order which is shifting.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_18 Some options, to me, seem to be more attractive than others and, who knows, there may be other options which have not yet been brought to the table.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_10 We must face up to the reality that Europeans' horizons have shifted.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_16 Having said that, reform does not mean a whole redesign of Europe.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_34 We have a fragile balancing act to perform a balance between flexibility, which is not so loose as to threaten the meaning of a real Union, and intransigent rigidity which would undermine the whole process of the European project.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_25 We believe in creating better conditions for growth, jobs and higher living standards through the Union's single market.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_23 These are the values that reflect the soul of the Union and form the core of any future Europe.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_7 Yes, we are living in times of extraordinary unpredictability and it would be a big mistake to underestimate the major setbacks and challenges, but it would be an even bigger mistake to fall into a negative mind set and resign ourselves to doing nothing.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_1 the European Union is not about Brussels, it is not about Strasbourg, nor is it about the institutions to which many of us involved in today's debate belong.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-09:53:31_9 Never has there been a more important time for Member States and the institutions to remain united, never has there been such a crucial time for all of us to focus on the big picture and shut out potentially distracting, unnecessarily divisive issues.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-10:55:22_2 It has nothing in common with the democracies of Europe and therefore Turkey should never ever be allowed to join the European Union.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-10:55:22_7 But they were men and women of their time, as it is a treaty of its time.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-10:55:22_9 Because what began as a noble economic plan has morphed into a political monster, egged on by successive Eurocrats, who are hungry for ever more power and determined to destroy the nation state.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-10:55:22_10 What continues to amaze me is that you never learn.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170315-10:55:22_11 You talk about an existential crisis but you say what is needed is even more EU. You are fiddling whilst the Treaty of Rome burns. So what I will say is simply this I urge caution when you are celebrating next week, because Brexit could trigger a floodgate whereby other countries leave that same Treaty you are celebrating next week.
20201008-0900-PLENARY-en_20201008-11:26:32_9 To Dawit Isaak and his family, I just want to say that you have many friends in this Parliament and we will not stay silent until the day Dawit Isaak is back home in Sweden in safety.
20201008-0900-PLENARY-en_20201008-11:26:32_3 Dreaming and peacefully acting for democracy must never be a crime.
20201008-0900-PLENARY-en_20201008-11:26:32_2 For 19 years, his wife and his children have tried to do everything they can to get him released.
20201008-0900-PLENARY-en_20201008-11:26:32_4 There is something rotten in the world when people can be jailed and in the worst cases, be deprived of their lives, just because they dream of a better society, a better world.
20201008-0900-PLENARY-en_20201008-11:26:32_0 Mr President, first and foremost, I want to thank all my colleagues for the good cooperation that has made this resolution possible an urgency that talks about real people's lives, because oppression and injustice are not only words.
20201008-0900-PLENARY-en_20201008-11:26:32_8 Martin Luther King wisely once said In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.'
20170914-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170914-09:18:11_24 Furthermore, the Council's Legal Service has been requested to provide an opinion, and the Presidency is now waiting for this opinion before continuing the discussions.
20170914-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170914-09:18:11_0 Madam President, I would like to thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to deliver, on behalf of the Commission, a statement on the Nord Stream 2 project. I know that this continues to be a subject to which many of you attach a high importance and which we have discussed already
20170914-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170914-09:18:11_20 Three different approaches to the Mandate can be distinguished at this stage in the Council.
20170914-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170914-09:18:11_1 a number of times.
20170914-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170914-09:18:11_21 First, there is a significant number of Member States which are clearly in favour of the Mandate.
20170705-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20170705-21:39:25_1 efficient in our support. Let me touch on a couple of things the Commissioner also said about it.
20170705-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20170705-21:39:25_5 This is combining help on one hand, for emergencies as the Commissioner said, and prevention for the future.
20170705-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20170705-21:39:25_4 support for people and also for the future.
20170705-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20170705-21:39:25_6 There can be a combination of those tools.
20180312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180312-21:47:46_1 I think the biggest thing is that we are enabling things to happen.
20180312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180312-21:47:46_4 We need to share info, and for that we need all the platforms where we can easily share information, and also where we can share the big data, which is very important with the ICT.
20170517-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170517-15:31:36_5 that should be understood.
20170517-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170517-15:31:36_7 It was an incredibly complicated time.
20170517-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170517-15:31:36_9 So, instead of blaming and criticising especially personally some people at the ECB, we should appreciate what they did, for the way our economy has got out of the crisis, for the jobs they saved, actually improving the situation in Europe.
20110406-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20110406-11:07:32_0 Mr President, in May 2010, Parliament voted for the Single Market to be perceived as a holistic, unified project, finding an equilibrium between an open SME friendly economy and a citizen's social and basic rights.
20180206-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20180206-22:29:46_5 However, this proud place comes with responsibilities.
20180206-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20180206-22:29:46_6 We need to look further, we need to address the major large scale political question as well.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20180704-20:25:31_15 They haven't got a clue. They don't have a plan. They will continue giving billions of our money to the EU and are completely split on whether to carry out the result of the referendum or not.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20180704-20:25:31_9 The Tories have agreed to hand nearly GBP 40 billion over to the EU as a punishment for having a democratic decision to leave.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20180704-20:25:31_14 The Tories have had two years to come up with a position on Brexit and show us a blueprint of what an independent Britain would look like.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20180704-20:25:31_5 The recent Commission statement of estimates showed that the UK will be handing over EUR
20120329-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20120329-10:32:56_1 This citizens' charter would clearly outline citizens' rights and obligations within the Single Market, especially for European citizens who want to move, sell, shop and work across borders. The urgent need for such an initiative was confirmed by the Commission's study on citizens' top 20 concerns,
20120329-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20120329-10:32:56_3 The Commission must now address these concerns by presenting the top 20 solutions as soon as possible, to restore the crucial variable of credibility among citizens to the Market.
20120329-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20120329-10:32:56_4 These measures would correct consumers' and SMEs' negative perceptions of the Single Market, thereby boosting their participation in the market and reassuring the citizens that the EU works for them.
20170613-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170613-18:48:07_7 There is no way out, and if he says well, perhaps a month or two later', I will not accept
20170613-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170613-18:48:07_1 The situation in the DRC is indeed terrible and it has been this way for quite a while, and I am deeply concerned about the handling of the current issue with regard to the Kasai province.
20170613-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170613-18:48:07_6 prepare the elections properly.
20170613-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170613-18:48:07_8 I think we should not accept anything unless there's really a broad consensus with all political stakeholders.
20150114-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20150114-20:00:54_3 I would like to see the High Representative, despite her comprehensive explanations, and the Commission take on an even more prominent role.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_9 And of course we took the decision in September 2015 for the package of about EUR 420 million, and of course it was done to directly support farmers and to see how we can leverage the supply and demand. Member States and Commissioner Hogan will probably say something about it
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_7 It is also clear that it should be a joint effort, a joint effort by the Council, the European Parliament, the European Commission, but also by the producers themselves.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_1 The situation in the agricultural markets in many of the Member States is very difficult and severe, especially in the dairy sector, and the Council is fully aware of this situation and shares the concerns of the farmers who have to cope with these difficult problems.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_16 That will be on the agenda of the June Council to be discussed by the Council, Member States and the Commission.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_10 are still implementing those measures.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_12 In March, we took 16 additional measures, together with the Commission and the Council, and those measures relate to intervention measures, they relate to promotion measures, to exports, as well as the possibility for Member States to give additional state aid.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_17 But also at the last Council it was clear that many Member States have stated that if we are again going to take additional measures, they have to be linked to a reduction of milk production.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_6 You see an average increase of milk production of about between 5 and 6, but that is not the case in every Member State so whilst stating that we need a European answer, at the same time we need flexibility for the Member States to implement measures which are suitable for the national circumstances.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_0 Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members of Parliament for their remarks but also for their suggestions, and certainly the Presidency will take them with us to our next discussion in the Council of June, because there we are going to discuss again the very severe situation in the dairy sector as well as the need for additional measures.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_1 I would like to reiterate what was said by Commissioner Hogan that the Commission and the Council were not resting on their laurels.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_2 Many measures have been taken, not only in September but also in March, and of course we see some effects of those measures perhaps not enough, but there are effects of those measures, and the situation could have been worse if we did not have taken those measures.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_3 And yes, I would like to reiterate that we need a European approach.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_7 And it is clear that the Council also stated that we do not want to go back to a quota system. I agree with what was said by Mr Huitema, that we have to improve the situation of the farmers in the supply chain.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_8 We have to give them a fair price for their products.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_9 Therefore the work of the market taskforce installed by the European Commission is so important, and in the June Council we have the first report of this taskforce and hopefully we get some interesting and creative ideas.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_11 But at the same time, of course, we have to support those farmers and see how we can help them balancing supply and demand.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_13 It is not the Dutch model of the Dutch Government but it is also the Dutch model of the Dutch dairy producers, and they are looking into niche markets, into improving quality, into new market concepts.
20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_14 But they are also now at this moment discussing possibilities of reduction of the milk production in the Netherlands on a voluntary basis, and I think it is up to the Council in June to see how we can support those initiatives of farmers' organisations to reduce the milk production.
20180416-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180416-21:37:08_2 That's always appreciated, and I believe we have come up with a good report.
20180416-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180416-21:37:08_10 Because the patronising attitude that we've had in the past has made us look second or third in line in terms of preference of many recipient states, and that effects the notional validity of the partnership was well.
20091123-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20091123-20:32:52_2 in one of my amendments and supported by the rapporteur refers to the fact that Member States, Europol and Eurojust are not granted the possibility to communicate data to non Member States and third countries because of the absence of sufficient data protection in those countries.
20091123-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20091123-20:32:52_3 In my opinion, the review of the customs information system as reflected by the report is necessary in order to adapt it better to the control services' requirements and to allow a limited number of users to carry out analyses of the information contained in the system.
20091123-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20091123-20:32:52_4 The review will also increase the effectiveness of the cooperation and control procedures of the customs administrations due to the joint, automated information system which will assist in preventing, investigating and prosecuting serious contraventions of national laws.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170315-19:17:51_1 Sometimes I have the feeling that there is a little too much of this innovative energy. We, in the Green Group, believe that the report is an important one the aim of it is a very legitimate and crucial one for the time.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170315-19:17:51_2 Had it been about unleashing the full potential of the Lisbon Treaty in the field of security and defence, we would have been in full support.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170315-19:17:51_7 It would be an agency without transparency, parliamentary oversight, let alone control. We are in full support of centralisation it makes sense in this field, but not in this way, without any accountability whatsoever.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170315-19:17:51_8 Secondly, we believe that, before committing large amounts of fresh money to defence and security, we should explore the full potential of efficiency gains through cooperation, and only after this should we consider additional funding that might be available through the European Union budget or from Member States.
20170315-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170315-19:17:51_9 These are the main reasons why our Group is unable to support the report, even though we are committed to a stronger European common defence and security policy and there are many very good ideas in the report in general.
20160607-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160607-10:19:11_1 and aggressive fiscal planning.
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_3 They have the potential to enable us to solve many of the critical problems confronting us.
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_11 In order for it to be effective, bridging the digital divide has to be mainstreamed into every other policy area in accordance with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_5 Digital technologies have huge potential in terms of reducing poverty, increasing the competitiveness of the economy and creating employment opportunities.
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_17 The private sector needs to get involved and play a role through its expertise and innovation know how.
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_9 At the same time, a huge increase in mobile services is securing across the planet and the numbers of mobile users are now surpassing the numbers of people having access to electricity, sanitation or clean water.
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_13 In the European Consensus on Development which is a crucial document on development policy of the EU and its Member States, we can find the bold statement that they will continue to support information and communication technologies in developing countries as powerful enablers of inclusive growth and sustainable development.
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_15 We are all aware of the fact that in this area of developing cooperation, public funding will not be sufficient for a truly transformative digitalisation process.
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_7 According to the 2016 World Development Report on Digital Dividends, six billion people lack access to high speed internet and four billion still have no internet access at all.
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_12 In order to realise these goals, both developing countries and developed countries, as well as all actors both public and private need to maximise and join their efforts.
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_14 Special attention has been given to supporting digital literacy and skills to empower people, especially women, and people in vulnerable and marginalised situations to promote social inclusion and to facilitate the participation in democratic governance and the digital economy.
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_6 Whereas digitisation is rapidly growing globally our partners from developing countries continue to lag behind, losing the opportunity to fully utilise their human capital towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_8 At a time when digitisation is growing fast, this lack of access is a major challenge to development as it continues to widen gaps and inequalities in the world.
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_4 If this potential is to be realised then we must find ways of turning these technologies into a resource for all people, despite the challenges they face within their communities. What does it mean?
20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_16 For this very reason, there is a need for public private cooperation based on development principles.
20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_9 It does not work, and I very much hope that we can take away the last exemptions allowing airports and harbours and so on to use these inefficient methods that make people feel bad.
20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_11 So I think this report is important.
20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_10 And how can you say that you will have a high level of protection when people leave CDs with 20 million people's data on them lying in cafés, and when we know how easy it is to hack into computers? I did it myself as a kid actually.
20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_4 Then you look at the anti terror legislation with profiling and you see it creates insecurity and it creates problems for people living their daily lives. You cannot combat terrorism with anti terror laws that create the same feelings of insecurity.
20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_6 We can see that it is neither efficient nor legal.
20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_8 The German surveillance scheme on 18 year old Muslim men in Germany was not efficient.
20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_12 The Council needs to adapt its logic and spend the resources efficiently, targeting specific individuals and focusing the time on them instead of going for ethnic registration, which is in complete violation of any human rights standards.
20090422-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20090422-23:01:25_1 This matter is extremely important because, from Europe, we can make sure that the latest technology impacts on the usefulness and efficiency of road transport in all its forms.
20090422-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20090422-23:01:25_5 We need more data on the windscreens so that we can sort out our own salvations in a more effective and efficient manner.
20090422-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20090422-23:01:25_4 So often, as elected Members, we journey round our constituencies and find ourselves in traffic jams, and so often we have to make phone calls to find out what the situation is ahead.
20090422-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20090422-23:01:25_6 I wish Mrs Jensen and the Commissioner every success.
20090422-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20090422-23:01:25_0 Madam President, I speak as a civil engineer, and my son has a transport surveying business stretching right through the United Kingdom.
20170704-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20170704-19:05:24_2 Give it to the Chinese?
20170704-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20170704-19:05:24_3 Sell it?
20170704-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20170704-19:05:24_4 This is the key point when we talk about cohesion.
20170912-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170912-09:47:35_5 This is exactly the moment when the governments should step in and some of them do, but some of them do not.
20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:52:32_2 Apart from that, it does not make sense to repeat wrong things, it does not make them more true.
20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:52:32_4 We will definitely not be financing military operations out of our budget in the future.
20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:52:32_6 Rightly so, this remains with the national budgets and with the national governments and parliaments. But we have to become more efficient.
20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:52:32_7 This exercise is primarily a more efficiency' exercise, because if we plan together, if we procure together, if we train together, that makes us more efficient in the tasks ahead.
20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:52:32_9 Well, in NATO he could block everything if we had to rely on NATO, any veto from any Member State would definitely block our access to NATO resources.
20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:52:32_10 We need a certain amount of strategic and operational autonomy as the EU, in order to be able to do what we deem appropriate.
20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:23:04_5 Finally, sanctions are part of efficient EU policies. I propose that we should make these more efficient, targeting concrete individuals responsible for breaking international laws and human rights violations
20130522-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20130522-08:59:39_2 Protection procedures are simplified
20180704-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180704-15:50:40_2 I would like to ask the Commission and the Greek government to continue the implementation of the approved legislation. Full implementation of EU law will generate convergence in the quality of the interinstitutional framework with the best European countries.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180704-15:50:40_4 Delayed payments regulation is a case where the Greek economy would have big dividends to avoid future generation of non performing loans when the next crisis comes.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180704-15:50:40_7 It would also be good to understand how revenues from income tax have been lower in 2017 than in 2016, even though the economy of the country is growing.
20171004-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20171004-16:31:37_5 During the crisis, under the threat and during the very limited time, a new framework, including the Fiscal Compact that we are debating today, was created.
20171004-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20171004-16:31:37_14 Spending money that people do not have is not a good policy
20171004-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20171004-16:31:37_4 As the consequence, countries soon after suffered with substantial difficulties, and people have suffered.
20171004-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20171004-16:31:37_8 Just looking at the data, I would observe that in the Eurozone from 2009, every year there was a decline of deficit to GDP.
20180315-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20180315-09:39:17_2 Secondly, what is the state of play on the Member States' competent authorities?
20171211-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20171211-21:30:34_0 Mr President, the roaming like at home' rule was one of the most significant success stories of the EU this year.
20171211-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20171211-21:30:34_1 Now we have to take it one step further by expanding it to the Western Balkan candidate states already during the accession negotiations.
20171211-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20171211-21:30:34_3 This would be beneficial to the economies too, through market integration and better services.
20180531-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180531-15:00:20_1 These include the sexual exploitation of Syrian refugees by those delivering aid on behalf of the United Nations and other well known international organisations.
20180531-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180531-15:00:20_2 Several countries, including the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, have announced investigations into the funding they provide to these and other international organisations, and that they intend to make measures to prevent similar situations in the future.
20180531-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180531-15:00:20_3 Through its external financial instruments and the European Development Fund, the EU provides billions of euros in assistance to third countries through international organisations among other channels.
20180531-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180531-15:00:20_4 I therefore have a few questions for the High Representative on a response from the European Union.
20180531-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180531-15:00:20_5 First of all, will the Commission or the High Representative order a thorough investigation to determine whether EU funds have financed, either directly or indirectly, the organisations where sexual abuse has been established?
20180531-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180531-15:00:20_6 Secondly, what is the response by the Commission and the High Representative to the abuse cases that have recently come to light?
20180531-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180531-15:00:20_7 In order to combat and prevent sexual misconduct within international aid organisations, is there room for guidelines within the EU's external financial instruments that would make funding strictly conditional upon respect for principles, oversight, guidelines accountability and regular reporting from beneficiaries on this issue?
20180531-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180531-15:00:20_8 Last but not least, will the Commission and the High Representative consider working with Member States such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to set up contact points in third countries including in crisis zones for victims of abuse?
20140113-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20140113-18:10:36_1 They showed that, with a more ambitious proposal, the fuel saving would be much greater than the cost of a new vehicle the relative cost of the increase of the new vehicle.
20120523-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20120523-10:20:54_6 I am prepared to pay more taxes but they have to be fair and they have to be good taxes.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180704-21:20:51_5 We had control on control, sometimes five times!
20180704-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180704-21:20:51_9 The aim is to perform better and to show it. Simpler rules, as the Commissioner said, to combine funds and this is, I think, the need for the future.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180704-21:20:51_8 So this is the aim.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180704-21:20:51_2 On control, I think we made big steps forward.
20171113-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20171113-22:24:11_24 This is why, to complement GDP, the Commission is investigating other indicators, including demographic
20171113-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20171113-22:24:11_20 Exclusion in any form breeds resentment, confrontation, extremism and sometimes violence. Integration, on the other hand, is a promise of stability and of peace, not to mention the economic contribution that migrants, usually young people, can bring to an ageing population.
20091124-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20091124-09:52:50_4 The moral leadership of Europe is important, but it also acts as an example by showing that green business is very important for our competitiveness.
20091124-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20091124-09:52:50_3 In order to have such a global agreement, in order to persuade other countries to come forward, we have to keep pressing by our example, an example which has its moral importance.
20151014-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20151014-17:52:50_2 This is why it is important to keep in mind that the international community will have to share those costs.
20151014-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20151014-17:52:50_3 The report is right in saying that without the contribution of developing countries, our global efforts will fail.
20151014-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20151014-17:52:50_1 When discussing future actions aimed at keeping the rise in global average temperature below 2 degrees above pre industrial levels, we cannot ignore the fact that the least developed countries are not able to cover the costs of necessary investments in cleaner technologies.
20170313-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170313-22:31:23_3 Everybody knows that there are some pressing European issues like Brexit, migration, elections in some Member States, but we have to take the expectations of our partners in the Western Balkans more seriously, otherwise we might lose them.
20170313-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170313-22:44:10_4 Our common vision for the future of the EU has to build on our most cherished asset, which is our unity.
20170313-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170313-22:44:10_1 If the Rome Declaration to be on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of our European Union will be about the vision of a multi speed Europe, then it will become not less than the death certificate of the European project.
20170313-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170313-22:44:10_3 A vision for the future must not formalise the present day frustrations.
20150325-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20150325-16:04:24_1 VAT rules that were agreed seven years ago are having on micro enterprises that have taken advantage of the Internet to set up small businesses.
20150325-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20150325-16:04:24_3 And one of his spokesmen sent you a tweet blaming the Member States.
20150325-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20150325-16:04:24_4 Do you think that is the right attitude for the Commission to take, or is it in conflict with their clear aim to create a digital single market?
20160913-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20160913-17:24:44_0 Mr President, I really want to say that, day after day, the situation in Turkey is reminding me and other people of my age, who lived in the socialist system, of the days of the beginning of Stalinist terror. But I suppose that, now, we are able to learn from history and to stop this development in Turkey.
20160913-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20160913-17:24:44_2 They are looking to us.
20140312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20140312-16:57:27_8 Of course I do understand the hardships for many Europeans in this crisis.
20140312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20140312-16:57:27_6 Cutting welfare systems is painful, but it is necessary to ensure stability and future growth.
20140312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20140312-16:57:27_4 The national politicians should have acted much earlier in preventing the crisis. They failed to react in time.
20140312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20140312-16:57:27_10 Blaming Brussels is, sad to say, a rather common way for national politicians and some others to escape their own responsibilities.
20140312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20140312-16:57:27_5 Politics is about responsibility and accountability.
20140312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20140312-16:57:27_7 You can see improvements now.
20140312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20140312-16:59:22_0 What I am saying is that the main responsibility for what happened in Europe lies in the capitals of Europe.
20140312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20140312-16:59:22_3 I agree with you that the defence spending is of course awful, as is the relationship with some of the neighbours.
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-16:35:19_5 If you look at the great challenges of Europe, they are migration and security, solidarity or the lack of solidarity and growing inequalities.
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-16:35:19_4 But having said that, our Group is also disappointed because, here in Parliament, all of us are elected to prepare the future of Europe, and that means getting into the concerns of Europe, and you know very well what they are.
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-16:35:19_8 So you do not need all these scenarios.
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-16:35:19_6 You mentioned the social pillar, and, of course, climate change.
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_4 How do we move forward?
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_25 now on. Every single Member, every single Committee and every single body of this House must be involved.
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_8 us. That is why I thank the Commission for having presented five different scenarios, even knowing that none of them will be fully accepted.
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_21 I cannot understand
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_18 We may have forgotten to explain that there is no alternative to the Union not in the past, not now, and not in the
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_10 I agree with President Juncker that the time has come to align expectation with reality.
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_16 We may have forgotten where we come
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_7 west. Europe belongs to all of
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_17 from. We come from war, death, poverty and hunger. We come from lack of freedom. We may have forgotten why unity is so important.
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_22 it. To conclude, this debate is necessary a debate about the future that we want for ourselves and for our children.
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_13 What Member States must do is to stop blaming Europe for what Europe cannot do because it does not have the tools.
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_3 The question is simple how do we want to deal with those challenges?
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-15:50:03_5 But also, do we want to move forward? This is a legitimate question too because I know that I want to move forward, but we cannot simply blame those who do not want to go further than we are now, by calling them anti—European. We are all Europeans. Europe belongs to all Europeans, no matter whether they come from the north, the
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-16:22:27_3 They have to be confronted with their own responsibilities. I think that this is a very important step to bring transparency, democracy and legitimacy to this process of reforming the European Union in the near future. Finally, I would like to
20170301-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170301-16:22:27_4 say that the EPP Group has approved its own strategy.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090324-11:06:53_5 Reshaping the microcredit framework can help us reinforce and rebuild our economies from the community upwards.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090324-11:06:53_1 I think the economic crisis has forced us to take a long, hard look at our past economic behaviour.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090324-11:06:53_11 I sincerely hope that, following on from this excellent report, we see significant and coordinated action at Community level to support the invaluable work that is being done by and for microenterprise at local and national level around the European Union, as it is a very important part of our economy today and a very important part of our economy into the future.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090324-11:06:53_4 Addressing and improving access to microcredit offers us the opportunity to address these past mistakes.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090324-11:06:53_2 That, in turn, offers us an opportunity to learn from our past mistakes.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090324-11:12:24_2 Looking onward to the future, I can see that city continuing to expand on the basis of these well allocated, well controlled funds. I would call for more involvement of the private sector in the way that the funds are allocated, managed and controlled, because the private sector can always do a more efficient job than the public sector.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090324-11:12:24_3 I would also like to emphasise how very invaluable these monies have been to the rural areas of the North West, where there are a lot of agricultural areas, which are vital to the whole economy.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090324-11:12:24_5 This is a very interesting development and essential at this time in the economic situation.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090324-09:38:50_4 Secondly, they must also be used to bring in private finance. Thirdly, because of different approaches from different Member States, we would like to look at whether it is feasible to have an EU framework for non bank microfinance institutions.
20090310-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090310-13:44:27_4 We have to ensure that our legislation is proportional to the problems we are dealing with, and particularly in the IPPC, which we have talked about today.
20090310-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090310-13:44:27_9 It could, by itself, be the biggest help for businesses in the European Union.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20090324-22:20:58_1 Ahead of voting on the legislation on novel foods we should recall the reasons for having been prudent and aware of risks for the health and welfare of animals.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20090324-22:20:58_2 We know, from our past experience with similar issues that tackle both food safety and ethical relations between humans, as the dominant species, and nature, that public perception depends very much on specific knowledge of the matter.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20090324-22:20:58_3 Consumers are increasingly sensitive about suffering and injuries to farm animals and therefore they have the right to be informed about the potential of cloning to cause pain and to waste natural resources.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20090324-22:20:58_4 Yet the development of animal cloning as a method of food production is being pursued without public awareness.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20090324-22:20:58_5 The problems with cloning do not concern just the welfare of animals, but also consumer confidence in food since it is believed that in Europe food is produced to a very high standard.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20090324-22:20:58_6 The Eurobarometer study from last October documented serious public concerns with regard to hypothetical future use of food products from clones. This is linked to the sale of imported food, which could eventually be sold in Europe without being labelled as a product from cloned animals.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20090324-22:20:58_7 I therefore agree with the rapporteur's approach urging the Commission to come up with a separate piece of legislation on clones.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20090324-22:20:58_8 Among other problems which have been covered by the amendments tabled by my political group, I wish particularly to support the sharing of information from animal testing so as to avoid the need for new tests involving animals.
20150519-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20150519-16:18:27_4 This has to be visible and understandable, not only among ourselves but also, more and more, outside.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20141021-18:44:22_9 This all creates a nightmare for the budget negotiations.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20141021-18:44:22_7 There is an ongoing tendency to cut as much as possible without any rationale, while at the same time taking on new obligations, new commitments.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20141021-18:44:22_1 We have a unique situation to solve the problem at no expense to the Member States.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20141021-18:44:22_5 So now, the reply awaited from the Council is whether the Council and the Member States prefer to put this money in their own pockets and ignore the commitments they have made in the past, and ignore the payments they have to make, or do they want to really address the problem, show their European will and pay the bills?
20141021-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20141021-18:44:22_12 The decision on the whole set of amending budgets could be made very easily
20141021-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20141021-18:44:22_10 We spend days and days trying to figure out whether the Council is going to respect its commitments or not
20141021-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20141021-18:44:22_17 We will create additional tensions in the budgets for 2015
20141021-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20141021-18:44:22_4 we have to give it back to the Member States.
20170614-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170614-11:59:57_9 So it is clear that we will continue to have great partners within the United States even if the Federal Government decides to stay on the side of the road.
20170614-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170614-11:59:57_12 Finally, my last remark to his House is that the world's reaction to President Trump's action proved that the European Union is on the right side of history.
20170614-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170614-11:29:47_1 united.
20170614-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170614-11:29:47_2 We have heard many of our political leaders in Europe say that we will keep up the engagements in the Paris Agreement.
20170614-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170614-11:29:47_5 That is our goal.
20171130-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20171130-11:58:41_2 We have to add now but have been partially reopened'.
20180228-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180228-18:17:01_0 Mr President, it is positive that the EU delegation in Geneva will give major priority to defending the universality of human rights against efforts from several countries to undermine this concept.
20180228-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180228-18:17:01_2 More than ever, it is crucial that the EU supports the UN Human Rights Council financially and politically to ensure that it can continue to work independently.
20180228-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180228-18:17:01_4 However, I deeply regret that the Council did not include a reference to the UN binding treaty on business and human rights, the single most important normative process currently going on.
20180228-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180228-18:17:01_5 I deplore that the EU has not been constructive in the process and hope that the EU will listen to the requests by the European Parliament and give its full and unconditional support to the UN binding treaty process.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170201-18:15:33_0 Mr President, the Maltese Prime Minister, Mr Muscat, has predicted that the number of people crossing to Europe will reach record levels.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170201-18:15:33_1 Most of these people will come from Libya to Italy via people traffickers, as we know.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170201-18:15:33_2 The best way to stop these huge numbers of people illegally coming into Europe and to stop the large numbers of tragic deaths in the Mediterranean is surely to turn the boats back and process the migrants offshore.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170201-18:15:33_4 That is why six European countries have now been in private talks with Australia, asking them which way to work things out, because they know that the EU way is failing.
20170201-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170201-18:15:33_6 Only today, we have been warned by Italian officials that jihadis are actually plugging the gaps in funding for their actual campaign by smuggling people into Europe, because their oil money is running out.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-12:02:07_8 Let's go forward.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_4 We have been taking into account most, if not all, of the concerns that have been raised by analysing the previous trade deals with other countries, and I think that we can say with great confidence that this trade deal, is in many ways, a golden standard for future trade deals in the world.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_13 It is not meant to do this, and this is why I would like to say to those who are not listening to the facts but following the alternative news and not trying to go into depths of the analysis of this trade deal please do not bark up the wrong tree.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_22 Thank you to Canada for this.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_24 It will deliver trade in goods and decreased tariffs.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_20 have been sending their soldiers since the First World War to defend our freedoms and our liberties.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_35 CETA is like a lighthouse for these guidelines, for many who are searching for wealth and trade.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_28 So from that perspective, I would say that every country, just like my small country, Latvia, will benefit from this.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_6 The first direction is protectionism, provincialism, decline and the building of walls.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_33 Will we take the direction of protectionism and closedness, or will we fight for liberal democratic values, for growth and for the new golden standards of international trade?
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_34 It is a unique chance for the European Union now to take again a leading position in the global economy and global politics, and in many ways the vote for CETA will decide this. Never before has the world needed such a strong Europe at this moment, and it needs guidelines for good trade.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_7 Do we really want it?
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_10 Of course, the CETA trade deal is not a cure, a medicine, for each and every disease.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_32 The world is watching the European Union and which direction we will take.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_21 They died in the Second World War for our freedoms and liberties, and even now, when the European Union is facing security challenges at its external borders, Canadian soldiers are again on our sandy beaches in northern Europe.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_27 Geographic indications, a lot of geographic indications for many of our producers, and of course the investment part.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_9 The second direction is openness to the world, it is leadership, it is effective decision making, it is growth, and finally, also, the bringing of wealth to our Union and each and every nation and Member State here on the European continent.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_25 It will deliver additional possibilities for services.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_3 I would say it is a judgment day, because since 2016 we have discussed in the European Parliament more than18 times in different large groups what this trade deal really means for us.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_14 Try to find other solutions for other existing problems, but go forward with this deal.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_36 Please do not switch off this light. Vote for CETA.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_12 It is comprehensive, but it will not solve all the problems that our workers, small and medium enterprises and people are facing.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-09:15:26_30 It is a good thing.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-10:12:09_10 This is because most of us believe CETA is good for our economy, particularly for SMEs, and it does not threaten our choices, values or laws.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-10:12:09_5 The SD Group has tabled its own consensual resolution which clarifies what we mean by progressive trade agreements by spelling out clearly what we like about CETA, and what we do not like about CETA and expect to be further corrected in CETA where agreed, or in future trade agreements more widely better provisions on sustainable development and a sanctions based approach
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-10:12:09_1 2014. We have voiced concerns, demanded changes and achieved most of those already on the occasion of what was effectively the second conclusion of the negotiations in February
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-10:12:09_9 The SD Group has decided to vote in favour of CETA.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-10:12:09_8 and improved transparency for all trade agreements in future.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-10:12:09_11 But it is also an act of trust and an offer of partnership towards the EU institutions, notably the Commission and the Council, with which we want to work together for a better trade policy, and towards Canada, which is a country that shares our values, our objectives and our hopes for a better future.
20170215-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170215-10:12:09_4 We welcome, as a Group, the fact that many of the citizens' concerns have been addressed through clarifications and commitments from the Commission and the Canadian authorities, through the joint interpretative instrument and the other instruments in the package. CETA is not perfect, far from it, but it is an important step in the right direction a more progressive trade policy where the benefits are widely spread among all citizens.

20150909-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20150909-21:06:29_9 Too many overly strong protectionist measures have blocked initiative, flexibility and opportunities.
20150909-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20150909-21:06:29_3 This mismatch is unfortunate for many Europeans who are out of work.
20150909-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20150909-21:06:29_5 It is unfortunate for our societies which miss out on wealth and prosperity.
20150909-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20150909-21:06:29_12 we need to promote flexibility
20150909-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20150909-21:06:29_4 It is unfortunate for the businesses which cannot fill their vacancies.
20150909-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20150909-21:06:29_8 In too many places in Europe, the labour market is rigid, even static.
20150909-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20150909-21:06:29_6 This mismatch in the European labour market causes an uncompetitive European labour market.

20180115-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20180115-20:12:26_7 The fact is, other than a small reduction in overall fuel usage there is no environmental benefit.
20180115-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20180115-20:12:26_3 In recent weeks we've seen a lot of propaganda outlining the supposed environmental credentials of electro pulse fishing, but the fact is that little independent non partisan science has been completed.
20120705-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20120705-10:01:00_3 We all wanted more in Rio, but it is not true that nothing has been achieved.
20090506-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20090506-11:09:20_1 Like Mr Hoppenstedt, this will be my last speech before this Chamber after 20 years.
20090506-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20090506-11:09:20_3 It is quite clear that some key EU policies will be undermined without proper financing and therefore we are happy to support the proposal.
20090506-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20090506-11:09:20_5 Secondly, we should also ensure that these organisations do not in any way become agencies because, if they did, they would of course be subject to the interinstitutional agreement on agencies.
20090506-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20090506-11:09:20_2 The Budget Committee recognises the importance of these proposals and their urgency.
20090506-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20090506-11:09:20_6 Finally, we would not want the Budget Committee's position to be in any way undermined by the rush for these proposals.
20130312-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20130312-21:52:39_6 with respect to equal pay for the same job.
20130312-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20130312-21:52:39_7 This House is still deliberating the approach to be taken for the revision of this directive.
20171025-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20171025-20:19:02_0 Madam President, I agree with Mr Telička that it is really high time that we discuss this issue in the plenary session, and I thank all colleagues and all Members who brought up this question. It is extremely important for consumers and for a well—functioning digital single market to have neutral, independent access to the search systems of air transport services.
20171025-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20171025-20:19:02_2 Transparency and neutrality in the search for flights increased competition and made travel within the EU affordable for many Europeans.

20171025-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20171025-20:19:02_1 The consumers cannot be discriminated against online, and their choice of best offers cannot be restricted by business models.
20180116-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180116-17:37:56_1 reminded us of this possibility.
20151202-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20151202-22:34:44_10 I think we should do more to protect local communities, as well as the endangered species in the park, such as the mountain gorillas and okapi.
20151202-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20151202-22:34:44_4 Yesterday, the Committee received the High Representative Vice President of the Commission, Mrs Mogherini, who again stressed the link between development and security. I would also like to stress here, in this debate on the protection of the Virunga National Park, the link between development, ecology and security.
20151202-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20151202-22:34:44_13 We call on the Commission and the Member States to further address the root causes of armed conflicts and corruption and to support sustainable development and peace—building strategies in the park and the surrounding region. We also urge the Commission, the Member States, the
20151202-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20151202-22:34:44_11 I recall that oil exploration and exploitation are not compatible with UNESCO World Heritage status.

20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_8 even and that's particularly interesting when there's no central authority in play.
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_14 You could use it for digital rights management, for music, films or electronic football tickets.
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_6 Let me briefly explain to you what this is about.
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_4 it has a lot of potential. Some people even liken it to the kind of revolution that was sparked by the introduction of the internet, and I have to say although not all my fellow shadow rapporteurs are here we had a very exciting, very interesting and frankly very enjoyable time
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_2 it's virtual currencies and distributed ledger technology, so one would be forgiven by thinking well, this is a dull and somniferous subject that perhaps will gently put us into sleep at this late hour of the day,
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_18 So what we advocate in the report is not to stifle innovation by regulating now, but instead to closely monitor what is going on by the creation of a taskforce which we suggest should be created at the level of the Commission, and then to regulate
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_10 Some of you may have wondered why it is so much cheaper to send an email or an SMS than to transfer funds, for example from somebody working in one country and sending remittances back home, because in the end this transfer of funds is not much more than an electronic message even today, but still it can be rather expensive 7 or 8 of the funds transferred.
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_16 It could also be an interesting area for government applications fighting VAT fraud or using it to implement an innovative land register. Of course, with such new technology it is early days
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_11 This technology could help us to reduce these transaction costs significantly in the long run, and I think that if we regulate well we might even have open—access electronic wallets where the transfer of funds would be decided by some sort of least—cost routing.
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_17 we are not at a stage where the risks that come with any such technology are systemic.
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_3 but of course one would be wrong, because this new technology has a lot of promise
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_7 Fundamentally what this is about, this distributed ledger technology that underlies the bitcoin, which is the most prominent virtual currency, is a decentralised database that keeps a record of any sort of transaction done within that database in a way that is surprisingly safe, resilient and trustworthy
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_9 This technology can be used as the title of the initiative report would suggest for virtual currencies and in order to reduce the cost of financial transactions significantly.
20160525-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160525-22:48:16_13 You could use this for clearing and settlement, automatic contracts for example implementing derivatives on the distributed ledger far beyond the financial sector.
20090421-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090421-17:43:34_4 I have lodged my papers with the Court of First Instance, so I intend to fight a very robust case.
20090421-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090421-17:43:34_3 All I would like to say is that the big fuss and bother about my parliamentary assistance expenses, covered by the media over the last nine or twelve months, has been a harrowing experience.
20090421-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090421-17:43:34_5 I understand I have a very good case and, along with that, I have gone for interim measures, which means that no money will be payable until the Court has heard all the evidence and made the appropriate decision.
20090421-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090421-17:43:34_1 I only heard the last 10 words.
20170613-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170613-09:16:44_13 Moreover, we have also succeeded in future proofing the legislation by introducing provisions on software updates and smart appliances, and explicitly banning the use of defeat devices. Finally, the label will be able to show information about, for example, durability or reparability, thereby further helping consumers to save money and at the same time contributing to the objectives of the circular economy.
20170613-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170613-09:16:44_18 close examination.
20170613-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170613-09:16:44_6 Focusing on energy efficiency first whether it is for buildings, products or in industry is more important than ever in order to ensure security of supply and a successful energy transition while promoting investment, growth and jobs.
20151005-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20151005-22:26:25_2 Two thousand eight hundred people and their families are now facing serious difficulties and are left without any income and even any hope.
20150325-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150325-20:56:20_1 The minimum wage itself is not the problem.
20150325-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150325-20:56:20_4 Some people are claiming that the German application of the minimum wage is one of the most serious attacks on the single market since the adoption of the Single Market Act. These protectionist measures create barriers all the way down through Europe.
20150325-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150325-20:56:20_5 This is very serious and very worrying.
20150325-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150325-20:59:02_0 Coming from a country where the social partners actually do the collective bargaining, I am not against a minimum wage, but it is up to the partners to decide what the level should be.
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_10 It was initially expected that EMAS registered companies would have performed better, since the EMAS environmental requirements are tougher as compared with older and better known certificates such as ISO
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_14 Among them is a line in the definition of EMAS which I saw as particularly important.
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_4 Now, the problem is how modern technologies can be used for environmental protection, and how industry or services should be helped in promoting the environmental value of the production.
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_8 Existing voluntary and regulatory instruments were not linked to each other in order to establish synergies.
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_0 Mr President, European legislation was set to encourage enterprises to improve their products and obtain higher standards of energy efficiency and environmental compliance.
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_7 From past experience we know that certificates at various levels were not sufficiently coordinated.
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_1 Ecolabelling as a part of the EU action plan on sustainable production, consumption and industrial policy is such a tool.
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_9 First revision of the EMAS scheme was not encouraging.
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_5 The goal of ecological certificates is to engage synergies with other legal acts that are tackling environmental aspects of the products.
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_3 It is about striking a balance between regulatory and market based instruments, with the aim of developing voluntary standards for various products and services or helping to optimise production processes and make more effective use of resources.
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_15 It would help organisations to proceed more easily from ISO to EMAS standards.
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_11 14001. Yet EMAS registered companies were not performing better, and the system of environmental excellence was weaker as compared with the ISO
20090402-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20090402-09:52:59_17 An impartial system of certification will be, we suppose, appreciated also by consumers. I hope that this will help organisations to choose the most rational systemic approach in order to interconnect different fields of environmental protection.
20141022-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20141022-17:30:24_4 The People's Republic of China is a global power with its all the means of a centralised powerful state.
20141022-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20141022-17:30:24_10 What I see today when I look at Hong Kong is a big powerful regime trying to silence those who actually have the same dream as I had once when I started in politics 20 years ago.
20141022-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20141022-17:30:24_2 By imposing a screening mechanism, the Chinese Government will disqualify candidates for the 2017 Chief Executive election who do not meet the government's approval.
20141022-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20141022-17:30:24_8 I am one of those who engaged in politics at a really young age, at 16 years old.
20141022-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20141022-17:30:24_6 If we do not speak up when fundamental democratic principles are manipulated, then we also send another type of message we tell those students that democracy is important for us, and we are lucky that we can benefit from it inside the European Union, but we do not really care if other people live in a democratic society or not.
20141022-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20141022-17:30:24_0 Mr President, there are many reports from various sources on the current situation in Hong Kong, but it is clear that the authorities are trying to manipulate and limit, in some cases even violently, the democratic process.
20141022-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20141022-17:30:24_5 When students peacefully protest for democratic and indeed human rights anywhere in the world, they deserve to be backed up by us in the European Union as a global power of democracy.
20141022-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20141022-17:30:24_11 If we in this House are silent, we approve of the message from the Chinese Government, and that is why we have to protest and make sure that the demonstrators are actually seen and that we do not forget their deeds.
20160412-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160412-21:58:59_5 Second, I do not believe in the Minsk Group, but I believe that the EU in the person of the High Representative has the capacity to broker the negotiations.
20090204-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20090204-17:04:59_1 It has got to give the impression that it is in the driving seat to solve the problem.
20090204-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20090204-17:04:59_2 So we have a European Economic Recovery Plan of which the car industry is a part.
20090204-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20090204-17:04:59_3 But in reality each manufacturer is going to look after itself as best it can, and each country will look after its manufacturers as best it can.
20090204-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20090204-17:04:59_4 There is of course a possible case for some support, some financial support to the car industry and other sectors to keep capital intact and to keep skills intact.
20090204-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20090204-17:04:59_5 But this can only be decided at the national level because the support apart from the European Investment Bank mentioned by Mr Verheugen can only be provided by national taxpayers. But there is one thing that the European Union could constructively do here, at least until the recession is over, and that is to give
20090204-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20090204-17:04:59_6 car manufacturers a break from environmental restrictions.
20090204-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20090204-17:04:59_7 The industry is already in serious trouble.
20090204-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20090204-17:04:59_8 These environmental and other standard restrictions make cars more expensive.
20090204-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20090204-17:04:59_9 You are helping to kill off an industry which is already in serious bother.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_17 In order to address concerns expressed by Parliament, the extension of the autonomous trade preferences is subject to Ukraine's respect for the essential elements of the Association Agreement.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_11 The unilateral market access granted to Ukraine corresponds to the first year of application of the schedule of concessions negotiated under the DCFTA.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_19 economic, political, security and territorial challenges. I would like to thank Parliament for the efforts already made to pave the way for a swift conclusion of the legislative procedure for this file in order to ensure that trade flows are not disrupted.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_15 In addition, safeguard controls are in place to prevent market distorting surges impacting adversely on European companies and industry, including the agriculture sector.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_8 As part of the 12 September outcome, the Commission also agreed to submit a proposal to extend, until the end of 2015, the autonomous trade preferences currently granted to Ukraine, as they will otherwise cease to apply as of
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_6 expressed satisfaction when the Association Agreement was ratified.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_2 The proposal by the Commission for such a delay was based on a clear request from Ukraine to take an initiative that would allow ratification of the Association Agreements to go ahead while leaving more time to discuss ways of addressing Russian concerns arising from the implementation of the DCFTA.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_3 This outcome must be seen in the bigger political context.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_12 The current proposal simply extends the duration of those autonomous preferences by 15 additional months, thus maintaining the same preferences.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_18 Most importantly from an economic point of view, the autonomous trade preferences have a very limited impact on the EU markets, and yet at the same time they represent a gesture of tangible economic and political support to Ukraine in a difficult situation, helping to address Ukraine's difficult
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_16 EU phytosanitary rules remain fully applicable to Ukrainian products.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:13:38_10 Let me recall the basic elements of these autonomous trade preferences.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:40:33_1 We must stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine in the face of the extremely difficult political and territorial challenges it faces but also in its process of reforms and economic modernisation.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:40:33_3 Delays in the extension of trade preferences should indeed be avoided as this could have an impact on economic operators' decisions to import goods from Ukraine.
20141021-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20141021-22:40:33_4 Even retroactive application risks not fully repairing interferences with trade flows and would be cumbersome not only for the economic operators but also for our competent national customs authorities.
20180312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20180312-19:49:50_2 It is certainly not neutral when it comes to women.
20180312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20180312-19:49:50_4 The bottom line has been said here over and over again, there has to be some stepping up of the work, there has to be some binding measures.
20180312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20180312-19:49:50_8 I hope and I expect the Commission to take this on board because it also means a lot in who we are as a player on the global level.
20180312-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20180312-19:49:50_11 Nobody else is going to take gender equality further, as well as social rights, in EU trade deals if we don't do it.
20170316-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170316-09:26:23_7 We decide what is monitored and when, and how, and if.
20170316-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170316-09:26:23_8 Without the power to measure, analyse and utilise fishing data, the UK will still be unable to formulate its own fisheries policies and will remain under the hegemony of the CFP.
20170316-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170316-09:26:23_9 This report is the Trojan horse, the cuckoo in the nest, the fifth column, the hidden enemy within.
20170316-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170316-09:26:23_10 Sign up to this under the so called Great Repeal Bill which is no such thing and the UK has lost half the battle to reclaim our own fisheries and waters before the negotiation has even begun.
20171129-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20171129-17:20:25_8 Now we have the opportunity, dear Commissioner, to take up full responsibility and ambition and take the side of Parliament.
20171129-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20171129-17:20:25_4 Our high level of ambition on renewables takes fully into account the recent spectacular cost reduction in solar panels and offshore wind.
20170704-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170704-10:02:25_1 My understanding was that, during the Maltese Presidency, over the last couple of months there was an important paradigm shift in the whole migration and refugee issue a shift from just allowing millions and millions of migrants coming to Europe
20170704-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170704-10:02:25_2 towards treating the root causes, and treating the whole issue locally.
20170704-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170704-10:02:25_5 What is the policy of the European Union, following the Maltese Presidency? This kind of paradigm shift is what my country, Hungary, has been fighting for for a long time, and we shall never give up.
20180116-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180116-20:56:23_2 The benefits of globalisation do indeed have to reach all citizens and all communities.
20180116-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180116-20:56:23_6 I strongly believe that the EU can make a difference in the essential fields of labour rights and environmental protection, amongst others, and also through its TSD chapters in our FTAs.
20180116-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180116-20:56:23_8 In conclusion to all that work, I can share the EPP Group's view that we see sanctions as a last—resort mechanism and would appreciate turning towards more effective ways to deal with the problem at hand.
20180116-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180116-20:56:23_11 The experience gathered so far at the global level shows that trade—related sanctions fall short of delivering the desired results.
20180116-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180116-20:56:23_13 We do not see conclusive evidence that sanctions could lead to an improvement of the effectiveness and the implementation of the TSD chapters.
20180116-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180116-20:56:23_15 The way forward is to consolidate these chapters and to strive for the more effective and sustainable implementation of this important pillar in our value—based trade policy.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_10 That being said, to address any doubts that may arise during this debate, the MFA is not an unconditional support.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_16 I believe that our common goal is to help Ukraine, but it is true that we need to closely follow the situation.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_4 to be dispersed as medium and long term loans. The assistance is also intended to trigger reforms in Ukraine, which is done by agreeing with the Ukrainian authorities a Memorandum of Understanding.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_18 This means that the rapporteur does not support any amendments tabled to the plenary and recommends closing the file at first reading. To end, I would like to underline once again that this report is just a legal base for the Commission to disburse the
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_8 Third, the reform process, which has been important but is not really steady until now.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_12 Therefore, it is crucial that the two unfulfilled anti corruption measures will be part of the new conditions.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_14 A step in the right direction is the adoption of the law on the high anti corruption court this last week.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_6 In that context, I would like to highlight three key elements.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_13 If corruption is not addressed drastically, MFA funds should not be delivered to Ukraine.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_15 In addition, the newly adopted law was signed yesterday by the President of Ukraine. The rapporteur welcomes this news with great satisfaction it means that Ukrainians take the commitment seriously.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_7 First, the worsening conflict and casualties in the east of Ukraine and all the many socio economic consequences of this aggression. Second, the economic recovery, which remains fragile.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_9 Hence, the need for support for these reforms in the context where many interests can play against, especially in pre election years.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_19 money, but they will do so only when Ukrainians manage to fulfil all the agreed and outstanding conditions.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_11 There are firm conditions to ensure that this money will serve economic stabilisation and support the reforms. It is very important to remind that the Commission cancelled the last tranche of the third MFA programme when some of Ukraine's commitments were not fulfilled.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_3 In other words, it is a financial instrument and its purpose is economic stabilisation. This is the fourth time that the Commission proposes macrofinancial assistance for Ukraine since the beginning of the war in 2014. This time, the Commission proposes EUR 1 billion
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_17 If we are serious about our goal, we cannot slow down the procedures.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_5 This Memorandum sets out the supporting policy measures which are conditional for the disbursements of the funds.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:54:28_1 I am very grateful that we are where we are now. Indeed, Ukraine needs this support and it deserves this support, and it is very appropriate to have this next programme now.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:54:28_7 I am grateful to the Commissioner that you although it is not included in the joint declaration explicitly referred to that, because that is what it is also about.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:54:28_8 We need to be very clear in this regard.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-21:23:51_2 However, the eternally crucial issue remains that of the implementation.
20130911-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20130911-19:09:22_8 We recommend taking advantage of the Lithuanian Presidency and the Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius as an opportunity to improve relations with Belarus, as soon as all political prisoners have been released of course, and to restart the political dialogue on, inter alia, democratic reforms, free and fair elections, and respect for human rights.
20130911-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20130911-19:09:22_2 nan
20130911-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20130911-19:09:22_12 Therefore, we urge Belarus to lift any obstacles and restrictions to the exercise of freedoms of association, expression, movement, peaceful assembly, thoughts, for the democratic opposition and NGOs.
20130911-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20130911-19:09:22_14 It is a very important instrument and should be used for strengthening people's understanding of the need for reforms and for the development also of an appropriate social net.
20130911-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20130911-19:09:22_17 I believe that all these and other artificial barriers should be broken down as soon as possible.
20130911-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20130911-19:09:22_13 We recommend encouraging the wider civil society, including trade unions and business representatives as well as the political opposition, alongside officials, to increase their involvement in the Dialogue on Modernisation.
20130911-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20130911-19:09:22_5 Some influential European politicians believe that Belarus is lost to the EU.
20130911-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20130911-19:51:52_5 We suggest that this should be done in a very thorough way in order to improve their effectiveness and adapt their scope, nature and validity, reacting to the developments in that country
20180207-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180207-09:33:00_5 Do we really need, in order to build a democracy in the European Union, to have a top—down elite selected and co opted by European parties, or what is really very dangerous put forward by European movements of national parties
20180207-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180207-09:33:00_4 If we are not a federation, why should we have a joint constituency that not even federations have?
20170201-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170201-21:37:18_5 They must take second place play second fiddle to the needs of our ports and our boats.
20150624-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20150624-21:54:57_2 It is obvious to everyone that the current system is unfair and has a devastating effect on honest taxpayers, including small and medium sized enterprises. Therefore, I cannot see any reason why we should not act in order to change the situation.
20170213-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170213-20:38:34_4 A few weeks ago, one team, Manor Racing, became the latest to collapse after administrators could not find a buyer. Smaller teams in Formula One are punished by rules that guarantee bigger teams prize money, even if they finish last.
20170213-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170213-20:38:34_1 Colleagues, you may think Formula One is just for petrol headed adrenaline junkies but actually it is important for our economy as well.
20170213-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170213-20:41:06_7 Last December, Foundem, the first complainant in the shopping case, had to close its shopping comparison website, and Yelp also closed its European businesses.
20170213-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170213-20:41:06_10 You need to show companies that they cannot be rewarded for losing time because, in the last two years, Google's attitude and behaviour has caused more damage to complainant companies.
20170213-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170213-20:41:06_11 When it comes to remedies, may I suggest that all companies sit down with their technological experts, together with the Commission, to try to find non—discriminating future proofed remedies. Thank you very much.
20170213-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170213-20:41:06_12 Let me remind you that time helps monopolies and damages SMEs.
20180911-0900-PLENARY-en_20180911-20:19:14_0 Madam President, dear colleagues, dear High Representative, I'm looking at these issues especially as a spokesperson for security and defence from the PPE Group, and in this specific policy area, it is so obvious that the US is and will remain an indispensable partner.
20180911-0900-PLENARY-en_20180911-22:00:23_1 We call for responsible engagement on key issues such as WTO reform and climate change, to name but two.
20171115-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20171115-12:41:10_2 He has made no effort at all to speak with the EFDD as a group.
20170614-0900-PLENARY-25-en_20170614-22:35:45_0 Madam President, our Group is clearly committed to transparency and accountability, especially in the use of public funds.
20170614-0900-PLENARY-25-en_20170614-22:35:45_4 A party represented by one MEP still needs to be represented in at least a quarter of the Member States in order to be registered.
20180530-0900-PLENARY-29-en_20180530-22:03:01_6 We want to make sure we make it more open and inclusive, less formal and rigid.
20180530-0900-PLENARY-29-en_20180530-22:44:10_3 This is very good news, as an important element of the strategy's success is to ensure everybody is on board.
20180530-0900-PLENARY-29-en_20180530-22:44:10_4 That is why we propose enhancing coordination at all levels, through the establishment of a European Union Youth Coordinator and the design of National Action Plans.
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_11 Citizens cannot go on being disillusioned at one summit after another.
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_5 services and professional qualifications, directives, consumer redress and SMEs' incentives.
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_3 lack of proper transposition and information potential of the digital market
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_7 Otherwise, for citizens, unless there is this realisation, this will become nothing more than a meaningless, tired buzzword.
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_1 This resolution is a call for economic growth, but in my opinion it is also an indication of the frustration which Parliament and perhaps also the Commission is experiencing vis vis the effective completion of the single market.
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_9 We are already feeling, unfortunately, the effects of protectionism in various ways.
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_13 However, and most importantly, it must be a market which is credible, well understood and trusted by citizens, providing Europeans with a realistic and holistic action growth plan in order to achieve a truly competitive, inclusive and social economy.
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_8 Time is running short and the continued unity and integration of the market are being seriously threatened.
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_12 The relaunch of the economy and the single market will need the continued impetus and input and hopefully the leadership of the Commission, and the committed ownership by the Member States.
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_6 Once again, we are discussing the potential of the single market, but citizens are tired of rhetoric and instead want to see the realisation of this potential because the single market is very vital for the European Union.
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_2 It would be deeply sad if, in the fifth year of this legislature, we were to find ourselves churning out yet another resolution on the single market and debating the same problems that were identified in the first year, amongst others the fragmentation and inadequate application of rules
20120613-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20120613-16:41:30_10 It is high time the Council came up with more coordinated, urgent specific solutions and decisions concerning the crisis created, after all, by the irresponsible behaviour of some banks. This Parliament and the Commission especially Commissioner Barnier have been making specific proposals and initiatives, yet we seem to move very slowly.
20181212-0900-PLENARY-en_20181212-13:38:30_2 we had an ambitious and thoughtful Parliament
20181212-0900-PLENARY-en_20181212-13:38:30_1 Now, for the first time, we had an ambitious proposal by the Commission
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-15:50:40_4 Delayed payments regulation is a case where the Greek economy would have big dividends to avoid future generation of non performing loans when the next crisis comes.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-15:50:40_2 I would like to ask the Commission and the Greek government to continue the implementation of the approved legislation. Full implementation of EU law will generate convergence in the quality of the interinstitutional framework with the best European countries.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-15:50:40_7 It would also be good to understand how revenues from income tax have been lower in 2017 than in 2016, even though the economy of the country is growing.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-11:31:44_3 On the future of Poland and Europe, state capture by a single party is not the future.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-11:31:44_1 I supported the Solidarity movement in the 80s, when the Polish Communists denounced us as zgniły Zachód the rotten West'. Today when I read a translation of programmes on your public TV and radio, I'm getting the impression that we are already close to zgniły Zachód again when we insist on the rule of law and the separation of powers, when respect for your own constitution is demanded.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-11:31:44_2 I wonder, can you explain to me how a simple law can overrule an explicit provision in the Constitution with regard to the duration of the mandate of a judge in the Supreme Court?
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-11:29:19_7 You said we should listen to citizens and to their concerns.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-11:29:19_3 Yet at the same time you talk to us about a Marshall Plan for Africa, when Poland is a country which has no development ministry, no development agency and invests
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-21:20:51_9 The aim is to perform better and to show it. Simpler rules, as the Commissioner said, to combine funds and this is, I think, the need for the future.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-21:20:51_5 We had control on control, sometimes five times!
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-21:20:51_2 On control, I think we made big steps forward.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-21:20:51_8 So this is the aim.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-20:25:31_15 They haven't got a clue. They don't have a plan. They will continue giving billions of our money to the EU and are completely split on whether to carry out the result of the referendum or not.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-20:25:31_9 The Tories have agreed to hand nearly GBP 40 billion over to the EU as a punishment for having a democratic decision to leave.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-20:25:31_14 The Tories have had two years to come up with a position on Brexit and show us a blueprint of what an independent Britain would look like.
20180704-0900-PLENARY-en_20180704-20:25:31_5 The recent Commission statement of estimates showed that the UK will be handing over EUR
20180118-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180118-10:27:06_0 Madam President, we all know that Nigeria is a huge country, the most populated country in Africa, and we all know that it is devastated by injustice and violence, not only on religious grounds but also on social, economic and political grounds.
20180118-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180118-10:27:06_1 That is why it happens that Nigeria is one of the five priority countries of the Migration Partnership and in that context I myself have been a member of a delegation to Nigeria on a number of occasions with some other colleagues here.
20180118-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180118-10:27:06_2 Migration illicit migration routes is at the origin of massive and gross human rights violations aimed mostly at women and defenceless children.
20180118-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180118-10:27:06_3 This resolution tackles the call on the fight against Boko Haram and its terrorism, but also addresses the Nigerian authorities, calling for reform of the security forces, to make sure that they prevent extrajudicial executions, arbitrary detentions and torture, and reform of the criminal judicial system to make sure that the law is enforced to fight violence, terrorism and corruption, which is massive in Nigeria.
20180416-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20180416-22:53:12_10 Europe has probably never needed solidarity and equality more than today.
20180416-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20180416-22:53:12_22 a single set of rules
20180416-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20180416-22:53:12_26 My only concern is that cohesion policy remains the main investment policy for the European Union, that it carries on supporting growth and improving the conditions of investment.
20171115-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20171115-15:54:16_6 In two years, 100 concentration camps were in place.
20171115-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20171115-15:54:16_1 One hundred years of communism in practice equals roughly 100 million victims. It was, and still is, a system which is based on two pillars violence and lies.
20170117-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170117-09:40:34_3 I can I try but she might not like it very much.
20170405-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20170405-22:06:17_1 We are still optimistic about this very complicated programme and on behalf of the EPP Group I can say that I fully support his stand.
20170405-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20170405-22:06:17_3 The internal situation remains extremely complicated but we must understand that it is our shared worry and shared responsibility.
20170405-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20170405-22:06:17_7 The major problem remains national reconciliation, which means serious efforts to develop inclusiveness and mutual trust.
20130114-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20130114-22:44:27_5 We do not even know if he is still alive.
20130114-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20130114-22:44:27_4 It is a tragedy that this can go on year after year without anything happening.
20130114-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20130114-22:44:27_8 This film gives additional arguments as to why Dawit Isaak must be released immediately.
20171211-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171211-18:45:07_6 Now it is time for implementation.
20170118-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170118-15:42:09_10 This would allow us if the government has the willpower to control our own borders, not pay a membership fee, and not have to comply with EU regulations and directives.
20170118-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170118-15:42:09_2 Certain politicians, whom I don't have to name here in this speech, should hang their heads in shame because of their dangerous and reckless policies which have allowed jihadis to cross our borders freely without checks.
20170118-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170118-15:42:09_0 Mr President, first allow me to congratulate you on your election.
20170118-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170118-15:42:09_14 We are the United Kingdom, the fifth largest economy in the world.
20170118-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170118-15:42:09_15 We have links all over the globe to the Anglosphere, the Commonwealth, the emerging markets of the Far East.
20170118-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170118-15:42:09_9 I am, however, glad that the Prime Minister made it clear that we are leaving the single market.
20170118-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170118-15:42:09_1 I think it's interesting that the conclusions of the Council meeting raised the issues of migration and security, because these two issues go hand—in—hand, as has recently been shown by the attacks on our continent.
20170118-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170118-15:42:09_7 I am also concerned that there was no mention of immediate immigration controls, which means that, by the time we are fully out of the EU, on current trends, we could have another million people come into our country from the continent.
20170118-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170118-16:16:21_2 What should be on our to do list?
20140205-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20140205-17:15:29_2 It is authorised by a UN Security Council resolution it complements the efforts of the African Union force
20121121-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20121121-16:23:27_16 That is why our group argues that we should be more ambitious, so that in 2020 we will reduce our emissions by 30 instead of 20, and in 2030 we will need an equally ambitious target.
20121121-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20121121-16:23:27_1 It concluded that science tells us that if we do not fundamentally change the way we consume and produce energy now, then we risk having a temperature increase of 4° years.
20121121-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20121121-16:42:16_4 Now it holds in its hands the very future of these negotiations for an agreement in 2015 for one whole year.
20180911-0900-PLENARY-witholdRO-en_20180911-20:19:14_0 Madam President, dear colleagues, dear High Representative, I'm looking at these issues especially as a spokesperson for security and defence from the PPE Group, and in this specific policy area, it is so obvious that the US is and will remain an indispensable partner.
20180911-0900-PLENARY-witholdRO-en_20180911-22:00:23_1 We call for responsible engagement on key issues such as WTO reform and climate change, to name but two.
20180207-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180207-18:15:09_0 Mr President, we, the members of the Socialist and Democratic family in this House, truly care about the rule of law, separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary, and of course we understand the legitimate concerns every time there is a risk of breach of the rule of law in relation to a judicial reform in a Member State.
20090507-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090507-12:04:26_6 That tells you all you need to know about the UK Independence Party.

20141124-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141124-19:43:56_11 What can be done to ensure that the revision process goes smoothly and is finalised before 1 May 2015, as specified in Article 19 of the Multiannual Financial Framework Regulation, so as to avoid losing uncommitted amounts from
20141124-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141124-19:43:56_1 but the programming stage is still far from being finalised.
20141124-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141124-19:43:56_9 What is the Commission's current position regarding the treatment of commitments for operational programmes co financed by the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and the Cohesion Fund, which will not be adopted by the end of
20141124-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141124-19:43:56_3 nan
20141124-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141124-19:43:56_5 As a direct consequence, there will be a significant delay in the actual start up of project implementation.
20141124-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141124-19:43:56_2 Only a limited number of operational programmes have been adopted and, according to the latest information available, only just over one hundred programmes will actually be adopted by the end of this year.
20141124-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141124-19:43:56_4 However, this implies a revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework, on the basis of a Commission proposal with the Council's agreement and Parliament's consent.
20141124-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141124-19:43:56_8 What were the main problems encountered, and by which Member States?
20141124-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141124-19:43:56_6 However, 2014 should not be a lost year as regards investments from the five European structural and investment funds. In this context I would like to table the following question.
20141124-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141124-19:43:56_12 2014? In this connection, does the Commission envisage taking any measures to facilitate implementation of the operational programme?
20180502-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180502-17:03:33_5 we have together reinforced the legal framework for protection of the Union's financial interests, achieving significant
20180205-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180205-21:11:01_2 it distorts competition, sometimes it helps to finance illegal activities and, if losses are too high, it can push up the tax rates in other categories.
20180205-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180205-21:11:01_6 I am glad that an important part of the proposal is the simplification of tax compliance, especially for small and medium sized businesses.
20180205-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180205-21:11:01_9 I believe that better collection of taxes should not be used for increasing the government revenues.
20180205-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180205-21:11:01_11 In my view, money gained should be invested mainly in the reduction of public debt and the reduction of the most devastating taxes for the economic growth.
20170704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170704-17:12:49_1 I am not going to go through all the details but we are able to support many elements of the three different scenarios worked out in the package.
20170704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170704-17:12:49_4 Somebody should do the planning for four structures, and it would be better if those who do this planning were answerable to somebody, possibly a parliamentary body, at the same time.
20160606-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160606-20:35:47_3 standard setters, academics and experts.
20160606-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160606-20:35:47_5 We think that the concept of public good for the IFRS should be clarified, as well as the potential conflict between the private nature of the IASB, the standard setter, and the public good nature of the IFRS that are applied today in more than 110 countries and jurisdictions.
20160606-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20160606-20:35:47_4 Let me focus on the main points of this report.

20170703-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170703-18:28:03_0 Mr President, I would like first of all to thank the Commission for the very clear stance on the joint statement adopted by the three institutions and the intention stated here publicly, beyond doubt, to properly enforce it.
20170703-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170703-18:28:03_7 In order for a country to be competitive, it cannot be corrupt. It does need to address corruption, so I believe we are doing the right thing with the DCFT, on the one hand, and with properly addressing and incentivising the fight against corruption Moldova, that is indeed the right thing to do.
20170703-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170703-18:28:03_8 I would also encourage the Moldovan authorities to truly reach out to the opposition and to civil society, and engage in this discussion if the discussion continues on the transformation of the electoral system, but I also encourage the other parties to accept the invitation for dialogue.
20170703-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170703-18:28:03_9 A proper democracy requires loyal democrats on all sides.
20171003-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20171003-20:01:37_3 If we look at the current situation for customers, no real safeguards exist against flight cancellations or delays.
20171003-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20171003-20:01:37_4 How do passengers really feel when they book a Ryanair flight, but they don't know whether it will ever take off, and then the company blames poor planning of staff holidays. It is not only the customers who are affected, it is also the crew members, who work on an hourly rate and don't get paid when flights get cancelled.
20171003-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20171003-20:01:37_5 What are the workers' social conditions if they are only being paid for the hours when they are flying, with no income security when flights are cancelled?
20171003-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20171003-20:01:37_6 Is this the model of aviation we want in Europe or elsewhere a new model of legal slavery?
20110927-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20110927-12:06:37_3 I saw him on television.
20090310-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090310-09:24:48_8 There was one main weakness, however, in that proposal, which is that there was no provision for the selling off of tyres that did not meet the new requirements after the implementation date. I believe that to be a major flaw.
20090310-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090310-09:24:48_2 Her car was destroyed, but she walked away relatively unhurt. This was because the car she was driving had the most modern safety features and this enabled her not to be seriously injured.
20090310-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090310-09:24:48_10 However, in the current circumstances of the car industry, given that cars are not being sold, it was quite clear in the discussions we had with the Council that, in fact, 12 months was probably unrealistic, and we had to consider the serious environmental consequences of getting rid of tyres
20090310-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090310-09:24:48_21 As Mr Harbour and the Commissioner have pointed out, simplification is part of this proposal and that is very important. Finally, I would draw attention to what we have done in terms of demanding greater emphasis, in road services, on reducing noise.
20090310-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090310-09:24:48_3 That is the context in which we are discussing this report.
20090310-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090310-09:24:48_9 That is why I proposed to the committee and the committee accepted an amendment stating that tyres that did not meet the standards after the implementation date should be sold off after 12 months.
20110203-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20110203-11:55:16_1 I would bring to the attention of this House that none of those three is a woman.
20110203-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20110203-11:55:16_2 I think it is very strange that the Commission cannot come up with one single woman who is competent for one of these authorities.
20130911-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20130911-18:45:35_1 It still has the second largest military spending in the world and it has a technologically advanced and innovative defence sector, yet we are still unable to translate these opportunities into a workable and coherent security policy.
20130911-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20130911-18:45:35_2 The technological, military and economic logic of a more integrated EU defence policy is inescapable but the problem is exclusively political.
20180207-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20180207-11:32:47_2 So, one thing is totally different from the other. Then, let me tell you something that is very important.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180612-19:52:40_7 The report makes reference and emphasises, rightly, the security, defence and political challenge that Russia poses for the European Union.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180612-19:52:40_9 We seriously disagree with that. Just witness the political meddling in the Brexit process or a number of European general elections, so indeed this is not just an issue for the east to consider, and this is not an issue for NATO's eastern flank. This is a larger concern to that we need to deal with. The second and, probably much more important,
20180612-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180612-19:52:40_14 Much as I would like to avoid this, we cannot simply support this file as it stands now.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180612-19:52:40_12 This is an obligation for a bilateral, individual response between Member States.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180612-19:52:40_15 Thank you very much.
20180612-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180612-19:52:40_11 I don't think I need to remind my honourable colleagues that this particular article is not traditionally understood as an obligation for collective response.
20180312-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20180312-18:45:56_1 the present Commission.
20170213-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20170213-19:01:31_7 In my last few seconds I would like to call upon my colleagues to make sure that we deliver a broad majority for a strong proposal and do not take it apart during the vote on Wednesday.
20160510-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20160510-19:29:15_1 The EU is the world's largest provider of development and humanitarian assistance, and with the adoption of Agenda 2030 last September in New York we all committed to the implementation of the new sustainable development goals.
20160510-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20160510-19:29:15_3 As the situation in Europe has deteriorated dramatically, I think that the new sustainable development goals should take a step further and adopt strong objectives to reflect the enormity of the crisis, while addressing the root causes of migration in the countries of origin.
20160510-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20160510-19:29:15_4 We want to make sure that the funds achieve their purpose to build sustainable economies, health services and educational facilities, create jobs and give a future to people in their own countries.
20160510-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20160510-19:29:15_0 Madam President, development policy is key in achieving a more inclusive and peaceful world by uniting global efforts to improve people's lives worldwide and eradicate poverty.
20130115-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20130115-10:45:40_1 I think we are in a situation where we should raise public awareness in Europe on the question of the research programme and specifically of its importance for jobs and growth. My question is, since we are now in the midst of the discussions in the trialogue on that issue, what is your
20111012-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20111012-21:10:19_4 Following the Arab Spring, the international shareholders of the EBRD decided to increase the callable capital so that the bank could extend its operations into countries such as Egypt. Initially, the matter was considered non controversial and the European Council did not amend the proposal.
20111012-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20111012-21:10:19_2 The result is a far stronger text, which recognises the responsibility of the representatives of the EU shareholding in the EBRD and reinforces the reasons for, and the direction of, our involvement in this institution.
20111012-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20111012-21:10:19_6 about beneficiaries and the impact of its financial intermediary operations. Furthermore, as a result of the committee's amendments, the Governor of the ERBD for the Union should now report annually to Parliament on the promotion of the Union's objectives with regard to the EU's external action policy, the Europe 2020 strategy and the significant increase in transfer to renewable, energy
20170914-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20170914-10:42:57_3 In the resolution we also address the case of the leading civil society activist Sombath Somphone, who disappeared in December
20170914-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20170914-10:42:57_4 2012. He was allegedly abducted by the police, and we have still not seen any reaction from the Laos Government.
20170914-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20170914-10:42:57_2 In compliance with the opinion of August 2017 of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, we call for their immediate and unconditional release.
20090204-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090204-18:07:41_3 I welcome the idea of a Lead State which was announced recently.
20121119-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20121119-19:43:02_0 Mr President, virtual transaction systems are constantly being improved in order to save time and effort for users, but their security is in my opinion a reason to remain vigilant.
20121119-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20121119-19:43:02_2 Many people are easily tricked into revealing personal information online and into making unsecure transactions with third party entities.
20121119-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20121119-19:43:02_3 That is why I think the most important measures which should be taken are raising user awareness regarding internet transaction security
20120214-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20120214-10:00:36_3 In the midst of this European debt crisis we always take the decision to fish, to consume more now and create debt for the future.
20160705-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20160705-18:52:45_1 We have a very intensive five months behind us, but I am really proud to have been a part of this process. We have achieved a lot together. This regulation is a good example of what the European Union can achieve if there is enough political will.
20160705-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20160705-18:52:45_3 Under the new regulation, the management of the external borders of the European Union will be the shared responsibility of the Member States and the European Union.
20160705-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20160705-18:52:45_6 One of the priorities of our Group was ensure that the agency had a bigger role in search and rescue at sea.
20160705-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20160705-18:52:45_8 This situation will be improved by the new regulation.
20160705-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20160705-18:52:45_9 Search and rescue operations will be an important component of European integrated border management.
20160705-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20160705-18:52:45_10 The agency starts by supporting Member States in carrying out these operations.
20160705-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20160705-18:52:45_14 I know that there are those who are not convinced about this new agency.
20160705-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20160705-18:52:45_15 I share some of their concerns.
20090422-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090422-10:01:07_2 This crisis has been brought about, as we all know, by a kind of casino capitalism, crony capitalism, and a financial services sector that has been subject to no regulation or to light touch regulation, as it is sometimes politely referred to. The fall out of all of this for workers and families across Europe has been nothing short of catastrophic. I have been struck in the debate and in the reports that have been produced by the very polite way in which we are addressing this scandal.
20090422-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090422-10:01:07_4 The fact is that the EU response to the financial crisis has been sluggish and minimalist.
20090422-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090422-10:01:07_3 I am struck by the fact that the Liberal and Christian Democrat groups are concerned at over prescription, or that protectionism may be introduced through the back door.
20090422-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090422-10:01:07_5 The fact is that we do require a protectionism, and those that must be protected are workers and the real economy.
20140312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20140312-21:46:07_12 We found ourselves in an academic debate, a professional debate and a political debate.
20140312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20140312-21:46:07_14 We have clear commitments regarding annual assessments of the work done by these three organisations
20140312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20140312-21:46:07_3 nan
20140312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20140312-21:46:07_5 the Public Interest Oversight Board, which oversees international audit, ethics and education standards for the accounting professions and the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group the technical adviser of the European Commission,
20140312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20140312-21:46:07_2 This is about the quality of financial information in the decision making process.
20140312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20140312-21:46:07_4 develops international financial reporting standards
20140312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20140312-21:46:07_8 the question of independence of the standard issuers and the governors of these organisations
20140312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20140312-21:46:07_19 The IFRS Foundation and the ICB will take measures for interest disclosure in order to avoid conflicts of interest.
20140312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20140312-21:46:07_17 and, where appropriate, proposals for IAS regulation changes.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_11 We have now created insurance schemes and other schemes to deal with the impaired assets.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_33 Europe has led the way in so many other areas it is now time to lead the way in creating the global institutions that will deal with the global problems we have, and provide global solutions.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_28 The answer is we must do that.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_17 Whatever the views in this Parliament, I think people have to face up to that as well.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_35 I believe that, whatever the different views expressed in this Parliament, there is a will across the peoples of this world to do that, and we, Europe, can play a major role in it.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_26 The world has changed fundamentally, and we need institutions that reflect a global economy in the way they operate and deal with the problems we have.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_24 We had domestic competition.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_13 The second thing we have to realise, despite all the different political views in this Parliament, is that global cooperation not just in banking institutions, but global cooperation in other areas, in fiscal and monetary policy and in trade has to be a very important part of how we approach the future.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_31 There are global problems that need global solutions.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_15 More manufacturing is being done in Asia than in Europe.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_9 Other countries have now done that.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_5 We found that banks that we thought were independent were completely entangled with other banks in different countries, and we have to deal with that problem.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_3 For us to sit apart, to be aloof, not to cooperate with other countries, is a recipe for failure and for an inability to solve a problem that is actually a global banking failure that has spread across the industrial economy.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_4 If we do not understand the problem, we will not be able to understand the solution. We had a power cut right across the banking system right across the world.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_2 First of all, that it is important that the world comes together to deal with this crisis.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_6 Whatever the party political lines that people want to adopt on this, this is the truth we have to deal with the problem of global banking restructuring.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_8 We recapitalised our banks.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_30 We have got to do that. I believe that the lesson of this crisis is that we are now in a global economy.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_14 Like it or like it not, the world is changing incredibly fast.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_27 I was asked whether I would ensure, or try to ensure, that the International Monetary Fund had the resources necessary to deal with the problems of economies that could not at the moment sustain themselves when there was a flight of capital.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_18 The third thing that comes out of this discussion for me is that to have global solutions to global problems we will also need not just our European institutions to be strong, but our global institutions to be strong.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_10 More than a trillion dollars has been spent on recapitalising banks across the world.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_32 That will require us to shape global institutions, and my message to this Parliament is very clear.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_29 I was asked whether the World Bank and other international institutions can help countries where there is substantial poverty being created as a result of the crisis.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_16 There is trade round the world at a speed that we have never seen before until this crisis, and we have to deal with that by creating a global trading environment which is free, but also fair.
20090324-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090324-16:14:16_34 This is a test of how we, having over the last 60 years created a Europe which has social protection as well as economic progress, can help shape a world where we have economic progress, environmental care and social justice at the same time.
20171026-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171026-09:32:35_0 Mr President, all Member States have very distinct legal cultures.
20171026-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171026-09:32:35_1 The legal system of the UK is very different to the rest of continental Europe.
20171026-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171026-09:32:35_2 A blanket policy cannot work in this Union.
20171026-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171026-09:32:35_3 It saddens me to see that this report is calling on the Commission to urge Member States to ensure the strict enforcement of EU rules on the free movement of persons. The EU cannot force an EU migration policy on countries which are already dealing with very difficult internal problems, such as housing and financial commitments.
20171026-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171026-09:32:35_4 I also note with concern that the emphasis of this report is on bringing sovereign nation states back into line'.
20171026-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171026-09:32:35_5 The report's references to ensuring the EU institutions themselves comply with EU law could almost be obligatory.
20171026-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171026-09:32:35_6 This is not a periphery matter.
20171026-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20171026-09:32:35_7 This report, like the EU institutions themselves, has failed to consider who guards the guards.
20130522-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20130522-19:21:16_8 This was a sign of mutual respect.
20130522-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20130522-19:21:16_6 Congratulations, especially to the Commissioner for his commitment and his tough tone, which led to the 1 March agreement and calmed the situation.
20130522-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20130522-19:21:16_4 We have been following the developments very anxiously in Brussels and in Europe, and the EU has made tremendous efforts to act as a mediator between the parties.
20130522-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20130522-19:21:16_2 Last December, only two months after the positive Commission progress report, we experienced a major political crisis in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The opposition was kicked out of the plenary, journalists had been expelled previously, and voting took place without their presence.
20130522-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20130522-19:21:16_10 Let us continue to work hard, keeping the country on the European track.
20130522-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20130522-19:21:16_3 The whole political process was disrupted due to parliamentary blocking for many weeks.
20170216-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170216-10:16:10_3 This is very much deplorable, but my problem is that this debate is somewhat out of the context of urgency because at the same time, we know that during this year in Iran ten times more people have been executed.
20170216-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170216-10:16:10_1 Kuwait and Bahrain decided to have a moratorium on executions for the past 6 years, and this is something encouraging.
20131008-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20131008-11:22:06_2 It is the only way people have to express their views about upcoming projects.
20131008-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20131008-11:22:06_3 The Commission proposal is reinforcing this directive.
20131008-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20131008-11:22:06_5 Furthermore, we ask for more social participation.
20090507-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20090507-12:04:26_6 That tells you all you need to know about the UK Independence Party.
20140415-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20140415-11:40:39_3 If you want to get rid of all these problems you mention, this is not the right way.
20140415-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20140415-11:40:39_4 It will increase costs and will be less competitive for the European market and for the SMEs that you believe that you are protecting.
20180205-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180205-20:59:23_2 This compromise, thanks to the determination and hard work of many of us, will bear good fruits.
20180205-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180205-20:59:23_3 I am asking for your broad support in the vote tomorrow.
20180205-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180205-20:59:23_4 We proved today that the European Union can deliver concrete results for citizens all over Europe, bringing positive changes in our daily lives, but for the full completion of the digital single market we still need many reforms and a lot of work.
20180205-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180205-20:59:23_5 We need to do our best to break down national silos.
20180205-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180205-20:59:23_6 There is no place for protectionism in our common European market.
20180205-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180205-20:59:23_7 The next step we should take is harmonisation of the VAT rules. We also need to unify copyright protection rules and open up the services market in the audio visual sector.
20180205-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180205-20:59:23_10 I hope that the Council will help us in these efforts. As for us, in Parliament, I hope to see this project at the forefront of our agenda.
20180205-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180205-20:59:23_11 Already now, I am looking forward to the review in two years, which you have just mentioned Mr Vice President.
20170518-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170518-15:04:33_13 2017. This forum will enable, for the first time, an exchange of views between all concerned actors, such as consumer representatives, industry at various stages of the supply chain, Member States' authorities and the Commission. Some of you have called on the Commission to propose a specific legislation to prohibit dual quality.
20170518-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170518-15:04:33_12 The Commission intends to provide the results of this mapping for the next SHERPA meeting of the high level forum for a better functioning of the food supply chain on 20 June, in line with a conclusion of the European Council of 9 March
20170518-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170518-15:04:33_8 nan
20091019-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20091019-19:25:18_1 The establishment of a simple, effective and transparent evaluation mechanism complementing the current Schengen evaluation is a most welcome initiative.
20180529-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180529-16:29:17_5 Early elections would be a sensible short term compromise in such a dramatic standoff, offering both sides a democratic solution.
20180207-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180207-16:54:08_3 Minister, the members of the Council should not appeal to the principle of subsidiarity, since we are dealing with European elections, not with local, regional or national elections. We, the Greens EFA, consider that the Parliament's electoral law resolution has been very shy,
20180207-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180207-16:54:08_4 without showing a true ambition to update the electoral system according to the new social and political demands for greater participation, accountability and equality.
20180207-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180207-16:54:08_6 We understand the urgency of producing a new law on the important subject of the European elections.
20180207-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180207-16:44:20_9 our electoral rules.
20150429-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20150429-22:59:14_1 as it is the institution taking the final decision on ratification by the European Union of any international treaty.
20150429-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20150429-22:59:14_2 However, the quality of the Council decision depends to a large extent on the quality of the proposal submitted to it.
20150429-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20150429-22:59:14_3 As I have said, any discussion on competence is a very difficult and sensitive one.
20150429-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20150429-22:59:14_4 We have had several rounds of discussion in an attempt to find a solution.
20150429-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20150429-22:59:14_5 To find one, flexibility needs to be shown by everyone and I will repeat that by everyone.
20150429-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20150429-22:59:14_8 A measure that could significantly facilitate unblocking the situation is a legislative proposal by the Commission to adapt the EUʼs legal framework to the Marrakesh Treaty ahead of the Council decision on the conclusion of the Marrakesh Treaty.
20150429-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20150429-22:59:14_10 What would not be helpful or productive is to suspend our discussions to start lengthy court procedures.
20150429-0900-PLENARY-24-en_20150429-22:59:14_13 I will conclude by saying that the Marrakesh Treaty has been included on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council that takes place on Monday next week.
20171025-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171025-15:58:29_1 You should not be able to set the agenda or frame our political responses, let alone frame our future. You should stop putting people against each other and stop lying about migrants and refugees, and you should stop confusing migrants and terrorists.
20171025-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171025-15:58:29_2 It is beyond all dignity and sense.
20171025-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171025-15:58:29_3 Smugglers exist because there is a lack of legal pathways.
20171025-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171025-15:58:29_4 To externalise borders in the way that some people here want to do is not to save people.
20171025-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20171025-15:58:29_8 We want to open more legal pathways.
20121212-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20121212-17:51:19_2 The problem, however, is that our current policy seems not to be working.
20180910-0900-PLENARY-en_20180910-19:34:04_10 This is together with the negotiation of the MFF.
20180910-0900-PLENARY-en_20180910-19:34:04_7 We must strive to defend it, and make every effort to further increase its effectiveness.
20180910-0900-PLENARY-en_20180910-21:31:20_13 For example, in February 2017, we published a staff document to explain our approach.
20180910-0900-PLENARY-en_20180910-22:02:30_15 New alliances are necessary, including with big consumer countries, especially China, and with financial institutions.
20180910-0900-PLENARY-en_20180910-21:47:35_14 nan
20180910-0900-PLENARY-en_20180910-21:47:35_2 In highlighting the complexity brought about by language diversity and the fundamental importance of language technologies on the road to achieving language equality, the report provides food for thought for developing future actions.
20180910-0900-PLENARY-en_20180910-20:02:21_9 And he did his job, two years later, three years later to see what comes out. And the conclusion is clear the work was fixed, the work was done.
20180910-0900-PLENARY-en_20180910-20:02:21_10 Good results and even with more capacity to perform in the future.
20180910-0900-PLENARY-en_20180910-20:02:21_12 Special times, special situation, special measures.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180613-20:24:22_2 Inequality is on the rise and of course that goes precisely to those segments of the European social fabric which have been the victims of a long, protracted discrimination in history the Roma community, of course, but not only them. Let me say that making up the budget is not only a matter in this House for a single European political group and that of course I do favour an
20180613-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180613-20:24:22_4 The second thing I wanted to say to you is that, in the current dispensation of the European budget, there is 20 for social inclusion, including in the European Social Fund.
20180613-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180613-20:24:22_1 Ever since the great recession got started, we Socialists have fought all along the way against the recessive austerity and in favour of a European budget in order to fight social exclusion.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20180418-13:38:40_0 Mr President, subsidiarity and proportionality seem to be the past, and President Macron if we let him do so will change the structure, the strategies and everything of the European Union, as he
20180418-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20180418-13:38:40_3 He wants a United States of Europe, while we European people want a Europe of nations of independent nations with sovereignty.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20180418-13:38:40_5 We, the majority of Europe, do not want migration
20180418-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20180418-13:33:54_1 On the one side, there is my country, Hungary, with the Visegrad countries representing clearly the majority of European citizens.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20180418-13:33:54_5 The important thing is that they should speak up much more loudly.
20180418-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20180418-13:33:54_8 But still, if we want to protect Europe and our countries and our communities together Hungary, the Visegrad countries and the citizens of Europe please speak up where ever you can and support Hungary.
20150430-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150430-09:30:09_4 So the time really has come for the Bank to adopt an up to date responsible taxation policy and that would involve three measures during the exercise of the Bank's due diligence, particularly for intermediaries which, as my colleague Hugues Bayet said, are a particular problem.
20150430-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150430-09:30:09_2 It is that point which motivates many of the requests that have been made of the Bank.
20150430-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150430-09:30:09_1 It is in all of our interests, for example, that the fiscal capacity of Member States is preserved, and that the EU's aid policy is not undermined by tax leaking away from developing countries.
20150430-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150430-09:30:09_5 Firstly, we need the Bank to make use of the measures contained within the Anti Money Laundering Directive and particularly to access the new registers of beneficial ownership of companies.
20150430-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20150430-09:30:09_3 The Bank did, in 2009, become a pioneer when it adopted a policy against non cooperative jurisdictions, but as we all know, that policy has lost many of its teeth as those jurisdictions have creatively complied with the letter of OECD requirements, rather than complying with their spirit.
20160913-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20160913-13:47:41_1 This makes them an indispensable sector in stabilising the European economy and creating jobs and growth in Europe.
20160913-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20160913-13:47:41_3 Unfortunately, the current instruments are insufficient and do not provide SMEs, especially micro and small enterprises, with the necessary means to finance investment.
20160913-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20160913-13:58:14_0 Mr President, for as long as I have been a Member of the European Parliament, I have repeatedly called on the Member States and the Commission to join up their efforts and tackle the root causes of migration, which is the only way forward in terms of providing a genuine response to the migration crisis in the EU and in Africa. The Trust Fund launched at the Valletta summit on migration is designed to help foster stability in the African regions and contribute to better migration management.
20160913-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20160913-13:58:14_1 Most importantly, the fund will help address the root causes of irregular migration by stimulating investment and boosting sustainable growth, and through job creation in the African countries where most migrants come from.
20160913-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20160913-13:58:14_2 We have to ensure accountability, transparency and proper management of funds.
20160913-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20160913-13:58:14_3 We have to ensure well planned investments so that the proposed billions really benefit the citizens through projects which improve education, healthcare and infrastructure.
20110509-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20110509-21:33:24_9 Of course, the European Parliament demands that the Commission be fully transparent in all negotiations and that we be provided with timely sectoral impact assessments.
20110509-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20110509-21:33:24_1 I believe that this opportunity should be used by Parliament to strongly support an FTA with Japan for the following reasons. The European Union and Japan are industrial giants that share democratic values and together represent
20110509-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20110509-21:33:24_5 The economic benefits are clear.
20110509-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20110509-21:33:24_3 We share similar challenges the rise of China, the global financial crisis, decreasing demographics and the need to access raw materials and energy sources and to achieve price stability.
20110509-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20110509-21:33:24_10 In addition, we will support bilateral safeguard measures, as was the case with the South Korea FTA, to avoid serious injury to sensitive sectors such as automotives, electronics, aviation and machinery.
20110509-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20110509-21:33:24_4 Therefore, I see great potential in further developing trade relations with Japan, our sixth largest trading partner.
20110509-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20110509-21:33:24_8 I would like to reiterate that non tariff barriers and public procurement are crucial areas for European businesses where Japan needs to make significant concessions.
20160914-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20160914-16:50:08_1 However, unfortunately, practice shows that there are always companies operating within the EU that will try to circumvent the rules to gain questionable advantages.
20160914-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20160914-16:50:08_6 They create many jobs in Europe and make important investments that is true.
20150114-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20150114-23:43:20_4 more than a year.
20150427-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20150427-22:24:17_1 Much of the credit for that goes to the rapporteur and the ECR will support this report in plenary.
20150427-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20150427-22:24:17_3 It is not just ʽmotherhood and apple pieʼ, to use the American expression, but it is of some real value.
20150427-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20150427-22:24:17_5 There are already countries in the process whose political systems give less than full throated support to the democratic freedoms and plurality needed for an effective university sector, and the admission of Belarus would give even more cause for concern over the confidence we want to have in the process.
20180206-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180206-19:24:43_2 The legacy is repression, isolation and corruption, and there is an expectation of the new transition Government although it is chaired by a former Vice President of Mugabe, Mr Mnangagwa.
20180206-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180206-19:07:18_4 It is probably a good thing that, precisely at this time when we are reconsidering our strategic partnership with Africa, we should get the chance to prove what we can actually mean in terms of reconstituting a democratic state in the southern part of the African continent and helping it along both democratically and economically.
20180206-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180206-19:07:18_5 Zimbabwe has tremendous possibilities that it could use in its relationship with Europe.
20170912-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20170912-19:37:12_1 Is there any other strategy?
20170912-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20170912-19:37:12_4 This is a disaster.
20170912-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20170912-19:37:12_5 It has to be solved somehow.
20170912-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20170912-19:37:12_6 It is not the responsibility of my country, Hungary.
20170912-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20170912-19:37:12_7 We are not the ones who are going to solve it. We are going to continue protecting our country and protecting the Schengen borders of Europe in accordance with our obligations.
20180528-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180528-18:19:03_2 First I would like to commend your efforts to increase the overall road safety by the initiative to include new advanced safety features into cars and trucks.
20180528-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180528-18:19:03_6 Thirdly and finally, I do regret that your proposal for a regulation on electronic freight transport information did not come a little bit earlier, in the first mobility package, because it could have served as a solid legal base for the enforcement part of the lex specialis on posting or for the Cabotage Directive.
20180528-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180528-18:19:03_3 Now we must make sure that they are going to be accessible to every future car owner, because safety must not become a privilege of luxury car owners.
20121212-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20121212-10:50:53_3 But I would like to ask you, Mr Giegold what do you think will happen if countries like Sweden, Denmark and Poland are outside the banking union?
20090504-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090504-17:16:47_0 Mr President, on behalf of my group I request that this package of reports be struck from the agenda of this session.
20090504-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090504-17:16:47_1 I think that this House should show some measure of humility and some respect for the democratic process.
20090504-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090504-17:16:47_2 We all know that Ireland has rejected the Lisbon Treaty and so it is of some wonderment to me that this House persists in debating that matter.
20090504-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20090504-17:16:47_3 It is not democratically appropriate that this House should set aside the verdict of Ireland or that this House should be used to ratchet up pressure on Ireland in the coming months to adopt a treaty that is clearly not in our interests or in the interests of the European people.
20090203-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090203-19:30:15_2 Very often, in economically difficult times, young people unfortunately get into drug abuse.
20090203-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090203-19:30:15_3 Is it possible that the European Social Fund could be used in a targeted way to try and help young people, considering the problems that this causes not only to themselves as individuals, but to their families and to their communities, and given the very severe effect it can have on communities,
20201005-0900-PLENARY-en_20201005-17:55:49_1 The EU is built on the notion that we are stronger together and that fundamental rights and values must never be an issue up for compromise.
20201005-0900-PLENARY-en_20201005-17:55:49_3 However, I am worried about the current developments at the same time. We see attacks on independent media, on LGBTQI people, we see attacks on women, we see attacks on migrants.
20201005-0900-PLENARY-en_20201005-17:55:49_5 I welcome, of course, the new rule of law report presented last week, but we need to go further.
20201005-0900-PLENARY-en_20201005-17:55:49_6 This resolution suggests important, measurable goals, involvement of civil society and a broader scope to also include fundamental rights and democracy. We must make sure that the EU does not remain a toothless tiger, because this report is good but we must make sure to provide it with teeth.
20201005-0900-PLENARY-en_20201005-17:55:49_7 One of the best ways of providing the tiger with teeth is through stronger conditionality linked to the budget.
